  Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of how the mind works,
  drawing on research from psychology, philosophy, linguistics, neuroscience and
  computer science. The interdisciplinary character of cognitive science is
  reflected in its reliance on many different levels of analysis of mental
  phenomena and its employment of a variety of methodologies appropriate to each
  level. The goal of cognitive science is to integrate the insights from
  multiple disciplines and modes of research into a unified scientific account
  of the mind and its place in nature. Research in cognitive science includes,
  but is not limited to, work on psychophysics, perception, linguistics and
  language processing, philosophy of mind and language, cognitive development,
  memory, reasoning, emotion, moral and social cognition, and judgment and
  decision making. One ambition of cognitive science is to understand just how
  mental abilities and processes are realized in the brain, and how such neural
  realizations can ground the conscious, deliberate activity of thought and
  decision. Another is to map out just how the human mind develops from
  childhood on, and thereby articulate the deep mechanisms of learning and
  cognitive development. A third ambition is to investigate just how far mental
  processes can be duplicated in complex computational structures that could be
  instantiated in machines.

      Students are required to take five courses in cognitive science, which in
      combination satisfy the following requirements:

      Three courses at the 300 level or higher;

      Courses taken in at least three different academic units (please note that
      this restriction applies only to a course's primary course listing, not to
      additional cross-listings);

      Typically no more than one course with a primary course listing from the
      student's major, unless permission is obtained from the director;

      At least one course that is not counted toward the student's departmental
      major;

      At most, one course may be taken pass/D/fail.

      Students are also required to complete a thesis or a semester of junior
      independent work that incorporates substantial elements of cognitive
      science. This independent work should be interdisciplinary, and it should
      incorporate methods or ideas from at least one core discipline of
      cognitive science, such as cognitive psychology, a relevant aspect of
      philosophy (e.g., mind, language, knowledge, science), a relevant aspect
      of computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence, natural language
      processing), cognitive neuroscience and/or linguistics. However, methods
      or ideas from other disciplines are also welcome: students can come from
      disciplines as diverse as music, architecture, comparative literature and
      beyond, as long as their independent work incorporates substantial
      elements of cognitive science as specified above.
