  Entrepreneurship the Princeton Way is defined as follows: You are an
  entrepreneur any time you pursue societal impact through broadly sustainable
  value creation.

  Entrepreneurship is driving enormous social and economic changes that are
  shaping our collective future. The program has three main aims: to create
  focused pathways through the curriculum that will allow Princeton
  undergraduates to supplement work in their major departments with a systematic
  and coherent understanding of, and practice in, entrepreneurship; to leverage,
  expand and enhance the University's offerings across the liberal arts in order
  to fulfill the previously stated aim; and to promote an interdisciplinary
  academic community of undergraduate students, faculty members and others who
  share an interest in and commitment to learning from and contributing to these
  areas.

    explanation: >-
      Workshops (without academic course credits) are offered on practical
      skills involved in the entrepreneurship process, organized as supplements
      to credit-bearing courses and offered currently at the E-Hub. These are
      short-term one-off or sessional workshops, normally 3-12 hours in
      duration, and students will be required to complete at least one of their
      choice.

  - name: Practicum
    max_counted: 1
    explanation: >-
      Entrepreneurs, however smart they are and whatever ventures they pursue,
      are, above all, doers. They apply their ideas and learning to try to
      create value for their customers, investors, colleagues, themselves, and
      hopefully our society. They challenge the status quo.

      This practicum is intended to give students the opportunity to fulfill
      their version of that endeavor — a significant firsthand practical
      experience in seeing what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur in
      whatever context is most meaningful to them. 

      It is not intended as a theoretical undertaking but a hands-on exposure to
      the reality of the entrepreneurial odyssey, whether that unfolds in a
      Silicon Valley-type high-tech setting or a rural village or underserved
      urban community someplace. Accordingly, the practicum should expose
      students to key elements of that odyssey, such as customer discovery,
      design thinking, solution prototyping, team assembly or market validation
      — efforts that test and refine hypotheses about what's required to create
      a financially viable, worthwhile venture.

      OPTIONS: There are five primary options for the practicum, each designed
      with the above objectives in mind. Any of these can provide the
      experiential foundation for the required paper and presentation:

      Entrepreneurial Engagement

      Startup Launch

      Solution Development

      Frontline Insights

      Wild Card

      Students should consult the program website for more information about
      each of the five options.

      A junior paper, senior thesis or other form of independent coursework does
      not by itself satisfy the practicum requirement. However, these efforts
      may facilitate students' work to design a related experience and
      analytical agenda that does.

      Juniors will explain their proposed practicum in the form of a poster
      presentation at the Keller Center's Colloquium in the spring semester.

      Seniors have two final deliverables for their practicum:

      a ten-page paper (due two weeks before the colloquium); and

      a five-minute formal oral presentation to a group of reviewers at the
      colloquium itself.

      Students can expect detailed feedback on their pass-fail “stand and
      deliver” summary from at least one Keller Center faculty member in
      addition to their adviser.

  - name: Colloquium
    max_counted: 1
    explanation: >-
      Students are required to present their practicum, or a combination of
      their academic work and practicum, at least twice before graduation.

      The required sequence is:

      April/May of junior year: Practicum proposal presented as a poster at the
      certificate's annual colloquium.

      April of senior year: Written analysis presented to evaluation committee
      no less than two weeks before annual colloquium.

      April/May of senior year: Oral presentation of practicum at the
      certificate's annual colloquium.

      This social event also serves to foster community and conversation among
      the certificate students. The mentorship of faculty in certain practicing
      opportunities and of alumni in others will also help to build a greater
      sense of interaction across the Princeton community of people with
      entrepreneurial interests.
