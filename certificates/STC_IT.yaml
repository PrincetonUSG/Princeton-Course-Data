  One would be hard-pressed to find any aspect of society today that is not
  influenced by evolving technology in a significant way. Similarly, technology
  does not develop in a vacuum; by virtue of its applied nature, it is shaped by
  the needs and desires of individuals and the societies in which they live.
  Society and technology co-evolve, so that you cannot fully understand one
  without knowing something about the other. This cross-disciplinary certificate
  program is targeted to students, both engineers/scientists and
  humanists/social scientists, who are interested in exploring this intersection
  in depth. Graduates who earn this certificate will be effective contributors
  to the shaping, development and deployment of technological solutions for the
  benefit of society.

  Students must select either the Information Technology track or the Energy
  track and take the technology, societal and breadth courses from the
  respective list of courses.

      Technology and Society (EGR 277/HIS 277/SOC 277). This course provides
      students with the intellectual tools needed to approach the rest of the
      program â€” a "set of lenses" that will help them view the issues being
      addressed in their work. Ideally, this course will be taken before the
      other required courses.

        Each student is required to take two technology courses from a list
        maintained on the program websites. These courses are mostly drawn from a
        set that includes courses specifically designed for a wider campus
        audience (with no or few prerequisites). An advanced/one-time-only course
        may be used to replace one of these courses with the permission of the
        program adviser.

      In addition to the technology and society courses, each student is
      required to take one course that combines technology and society in an
      area outside their chosen major. Engineering/science students should take
      a breadth course based in the societal disciplines, and humanities and
      social science students should take a breadth course based in the
      science/technology disciplines.

      All students are required to undertake a one-term independent research
      project in IT or Energy and Society. For A.B. students, this includes a
      junior paper. This may be substituted by a significant component in their
      senior thesis (at least a chapter). It is expected that some of these
      projects/theses will be jointly supervised by faculty members across the
      University divisions. The project/thesis component requires preapproval
      from the student's program adviser.

      Annual Symposium. Students are required to present their projects/theses
      to the program students and faculty at an annual symposium held in the
      spring. This provides a mechanism for shared learning as well as for
      developing the common themes across the program.
