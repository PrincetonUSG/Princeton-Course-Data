  For the final year, AAS offers a certificate in African American Studies for
  students majoring in another department. Students may apply for formal
  admission to the certificate program at any time once they have taken and
  achieved satisfactory standing in any AAS course.  

  The Program in African American Studies was founded on the assumption that the
  study of African American history and culture, and of the role that race has
  played in shaping the life and the institutions of the United States, is
  central to an American liberal education. Given the continuing and evolving
  centrality of race in American political, economic, social and cultural life,
  and indeed, in every region of the world, reflection on race and on the
  distinctive experiences of Black people is indispensable for all Princeton
  students as global citizens. Drawing on a core of distinguished faculty in
  areas such as art and archaeology, comparative literature, English, history,
  philosophy, law and political science, psychology, religion and sociology, the
  program promotes teaching and research of race with a focus on the experience
  of African Americans in the United States.

  AAS offers an undergraduate certificate that expands and deepens a student's
  understanding of race in the United States and in the world. Earning a
  certificate is straightforward and allows students to experience an enriching
  course of study that complements any Princeton major. Students who opt to
  pursue a certificate gain access to an extraordinary bibliography that
  prepares them to think about race and power in sophisticated ways. Students
  are trained in the methods, themes and ideas that inform interdisciplinary
  scholarship, with a particular focus on race and racial inequality.
