  The Certificate Program in Optimization and Quantitative Decision Science
  (OQDS) is focused on developing quantitative skills for optimal
  decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. Through this
  certificate program, students will learn to quantify risk and uncertainty, and
  to view any complex decision through the lens of mathematical optimization.
  This outlook will give them a more structured understanding of the decision
  itself, as they learn to rigorously formulate their constraints, objective
  functions(s) and the uncertainties involved. It will also lead students to the
  proper algorithmic tools that are needed to arrive at an optimal decision.

      Three elective courses on applications to quantitative decision-making.
      Students may choose to take more than one course from category (1) or (2)
      and count the additional course(s) toward category (3) as long as they
      take at least one course from category (3).

      A senior thesis or project must be completed and submitted to the program
      director (oqds@princeton.edu) that demonstrates a command of some portion
      of the core disciplines of uncertainty analysis and/or optimization.
      Students in engineering departments that require a one-semester project
      can typically use a suitably designed project to satisfy the requirement.

      Acceptable theses can be on a wide range of topics, but they must
      demonstrate a command of the core disciplines of the OQDS certificate
      program, including stochastics and/or optimization. The thesis must
      demonstrate, in appropriate mathematics, the ability to model a problem
      and perform analysis that leads to some conclusion or scientific result. A
      thesis with minimal or no mathematical modeling is not acceptable.

      Theses that are not allowed include "soft" topics such as the history of a
      nation's economy, and hard-science theses (laboratory-based theses) that
      do not have a significant modeling or data-analysis component (for
      example, collecting observations and computing basic statistics is not
      sufficient).
