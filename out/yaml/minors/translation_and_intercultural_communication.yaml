  The Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication (PTIC) takes
  linguistic translation as its base and offers a diverse set of undergraduate
  courses that allow students to develop an understanding of translation from
  varied perspectives. Most courses are taught by faculty in humanities
  departments, but we also consider the ways translation functions in the social
  sciences, the hard sciences, the arts, and engineering. At PTIC, we recognize
  translation as crucial to the production and circulation of work in all
  fields, and to our everyday lives as inhabitants of a multilingual and
  interconnected world. Undergraduates in our program have pursued majors in
  departments including anthropology, comparative literature, ecology and
  evolutionary biology, history, Near Eastern studies, operations research and
  financial engineering, politics, and many more. We encourage students from all
  departments and disciplines to explore our offerings, regardless of their
  prior experience with translation.

      Before entering the minor, students should normally have satisfied the
      University's language requirement for general education (i.e., completed
      or demonstrated proficiency in a language sequence through 107/108).
      Native or near-native fluency in a language not offered by the University
      can also be counted toward the language prerequisite of PTIC.

      Students pursuing the minor must engage either in a substantial (15-20
      page or more) project of translation or interpretation, or a project in
      translation studies. Students are encouraged to discuss their ideas with
      the program director before embarking on the project.

      A practical translation project can take the form of a written translation
      with critical reflection on the process and product, or formal or informal
      interpreting work done on a volunteer or professional basis, again with
      written reflection on the same. This translation may be completed as part
      of a student's coursework, or as part of their independent work for their
      department (JP or thesis), but it must be submitted separately to the
      program director for approval.

      A project in translation studies is a substantial piece of independent
      research that, while not itself a translation, engages with some aspect of
      translation from a theoretical, historical or computational perspective.
      As with a practical translation project, a project in translation studies
      may be completed as part of a student's coursework, or as part of their
      independent work for their department (JP or thesis), but it must be
      submitted separately to the program director for approval.
