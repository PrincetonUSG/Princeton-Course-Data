  The minor in neuroscience at Princeton is designed for Princeton University
  undergraduate students with a strong interest in the brain but whose primary
  studies are in a different subject area. The certificate in neuroscience has
  been serving this function since 2006, but since neuroscience now has a major,
  transitioning the certificate to a minor is appropriate. The PNI faculty
  believe that the current requirements of the NEU certificate are sufficient
  for a minor and have endorsed changing the name without modifications to the
  requirements. The requirements for the NEU minor are all related to
  coursework. There is no independent work requirement for the neuroscience
  certificate.

    explanation: >-
      In addition to the two prerequisites, all students are expected to take at
      least four neuroscience electives from three out of four subject areas.
      These areas include: (1) molecular/cellular/disease; (2) neural
      computation; (3) systems and circuits; and (4) social and cognitive
      neuroscience. Students should consult the NEU electives list for a
      complete list of possibilities.

      Cross-listed NEU courses will not count twice in the elective total.
      Courses can only be used one time and in one elective category. A maximum
      of two courses can be used for the minor and to serve requirements for the
      student's major.
