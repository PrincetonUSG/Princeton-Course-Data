      Students pursuing a minor in classics choose one of two pathways. These
      can combine courses taught in the original language and in translation.
      Each pathway requires the completion of five courses, four of which must
      be CLA, CLG 108 or above, or LAT 108 or above. The fifth can be a relevant
      course offered in another department approved by the DUS.
