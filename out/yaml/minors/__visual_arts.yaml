      VIS 392 Artist and Studio is a fall seminar required for all junior year
      Practice of Art students and students engaged in the visual arts minor.
      Concentrating on the traditions, challenges and rewards of studio practice
      through readings, discussions, studio critiques and a culminating
      exhibition of artist's books, VIS 392 provides students with historical
      context as well as contemporary theory of how best to engage in a
      meaningful studio practice. In conjunction with the seminar, each junior
      receives their own art studio. Please note that film students are required
      to take VIS 419 (The Film Seminar) in the spring of their junior year as
      one of the two required film seminars. They may take VIS 392 as their
      second required seminar or find another film-related seminar on campus
      that qualifies, with prior approval from film faculty.

      Students will be assigned one adviser in the fall and a different adviser
      for the spring, both chosen from the Program in Visual Arts faculty. Each
      student is assigned a studio workspace for the year in the loft of 185
      Nassau. In lieu of writing a fall paper, students will conceive and
      produce a 32-page artist's book for their fall independent work. The
      independent work is done in consultation with each student's adviser.

      Over the spring semester, students prepare independent work in their
      studios, in consultation with their spring semester adviser, culminating
      in an exhibition as part of the junior thesis group show.

      Please note that film students work with one adviser throughout their
      junior year to create a junior film.
