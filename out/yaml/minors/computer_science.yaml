  The Computer Science Minor is designed for students who want to combine the
  study of computing and computers with another academic discipline. The program
  welcomes students not only from areas that traditionally make heavy use of
  computation (such as engineering, the natural sciences and mathematics) but
  also from newer and emerging application areas (such as neuroscience, digital
  humanities, technology policy, music, visual arts, economics, linguistics and
  philosophy). Many students find this program an effective way to apply
  computer science to their own specialties, and to understand how computation
  and technology are transforming our world.

      Three additional Princeton COS course at the 200-, 300-, or 400-level,
      except IW courses (COS 397, 398, 497 and 498). This includes courses
      cross-listed in COS, regardless of the home department. It excludes
      graduate courses and courses taken at other institutions. If a student
      takes both COS 217 and COS 226, then one of them may count as an elective.
