  The minor in Music Performance is a rigorous opportunity for students to study
  the performance of vocal and instrumental music (both jazz and classical) or
  conducting in the context of a liberal arts education. It provides extensive
  opportunities for students to hone their skills through participation in
  department ensembles, recitals, studio instruction and performance classes,
  and also requires coursework in the Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials
  and Making (M&M) distribution areas. The MPP minor provides a solid foundation
  for students who may wish to pursue professional music training at the
  graduate level.

      By petition to the relevant program director, one of these electives can
      be outside MUS, though must reflect a coherent plan of study (i.e., a
      particular African American studies course in support of a plan of study
      focusing on Jazz Performance).

    max_counted: 1
    explanation: >-
      Ensemble participation in an approved faculty-led Music Department
      Ensemble is required in all four semesters of the junior and senior years.
      The specific ensemble must be for the instrument and performance tradition
      for which the student was admitted. For cases in which the department does
      not offer a faculty-led ensemble for the instrument (e.g., classical
      piano, classical guitar, conducting), students may audition for a
      different faculty-led ensemble to fulfill the MPP minor ensemble
      participation requirement, or may pursue equivalent collaborative
      assignments as detailed on the Music Department website.

    explanation: >-
      Studio lessons are required and must be taken with a Department of Music
      studio instructor or, if applicable, a program director. More specific
      parameters will differ depending on the instrument/performance practice
      for which the student is admitted. Students will have the option to enroll
      in lessons for credit (MPP298/299) if they want their work in lessons to
      be specifically reflected on their transcript. Students who choose to do
      so may NOT count this course toward completion of MPP course requirements.

      A recital or related program-specific performance is required in senior

      approved by both applicable studio instructor and relevant program
      director.
