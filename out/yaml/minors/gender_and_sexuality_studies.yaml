  The Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary forum for
  the study of gender and sexuality, as well as their intersections with race,
  class, ethnicity and physical ability across cultures and global geographies
  both past and present. The program's courses, which are open to all students,
  examine gender and sexuality from a variety of disciplinary and
  interdisciplinary perspectives. The program offers core courses, seminars and
  cross-listed courses. A current list of course offerings is available on the
  program website. The program also encourages summer internships in relevant
  community-based programs, nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations with
  which the program's theoretical and historical inquiries can be applied in a
  practical setting.
