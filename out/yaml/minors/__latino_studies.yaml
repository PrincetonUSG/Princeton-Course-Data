  The Program in Latino Studies, administered by the Effron Center for the Study
  of America, offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that traverses the arts,
  humanities and social sciences. The program is designed to provide students
  with a broad understanding of the emergence, transformation and consolidation
  of Latino/a/x as a pan-ethnic group central to the development of the United
  States as a nation. The course of study also highlights the transnational
  connections and contexts of Latino/a/x peoples across the Americas, including
  dynamics of globalization, migration, colonialism, imperialism, citizenship
  and diaspora.

      Three courses in Latino studies, either originating in the program or

      social sciences, arts and humanities. No more than one course taken in
      fulfillment of the student's concentration may be counted toward the
      certificate. With the approval of the associate director, a student may
      substitute a comparative race and ethnicity course that contains
      substantial Latino studies content for one of these courses.
