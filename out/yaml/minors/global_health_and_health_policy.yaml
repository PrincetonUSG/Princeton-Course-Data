description: >-
  Princeton students are part of a new global health generation â€” a generation
  that witnesses first-hand the pressing health challenges in the world and
  wants to do something about them. The minor in Global Health and Health Policy
  (GHP) equips students with the cutting-edge tools, real-life experiences and
  critical perspectives to make meaningful change in the health sphere.

  The minor in Global Health and Health Policy provides students a foundational
  grounding in the core interdisciplinary issues of global health. These include
  the biological, social and environmental determinants of health; public health
  policy and politics; epidemiology; comparative approaches to health-care
  provision; medical anthropology; health ethics; and social justice.
  Participating students learn about and collaborate with diverse communities
  around the world and in the United States.

      By the end of sophomore year, prospective applicants must complete one
      Foundations prerequisite course and one Statistics prerequisite course,
      with a grade of B or higher.

      Foundations prerequisite course options include: ANT 240, GSS 201,
      ISC-231-234, MOL 101, MOL/EEB 211, MOL/EEB 214, SOC 217, URB 201, EEB 309,
      EEB 314, EEB 327, and EEB 328.

      Statistics prerequisite course options include: ECO 202, MOL 290, ORF 245,
      POL 345, PSY 251, SML 201, SOC 301, SPI 200, ECO 302, ECO 312, and ORF
      405.

      Applicants should also have maintained a cumulative 3.0 GPA through the
      time of application. Students with a cumulative GPA below 3.0, or who have
      not completed both prerequisite courses, may still apply to the minor
      during the sophomore spring with an explanation of any extenuating
      circumstances.

      Students take two core GHP courses together as a cohort during their
      junior year. They are GHP 350: Critical Perspectives in Global Health
      Policy (fall semester) and GHP 351: Epidemiology: An Ecological and
      Evolutionary Perspective (spring semester). Exceptions to the core courses
      being taken during the junior year can be made when a student will be
      studying abroad, is on a leave of absence or will otherwise be off-campus;
      or when a student has a timing conflict with a required concentration
      course. These core courses may not be taken on a pass/D/fail basis.

      NOTE: Due to the nature of these requirements, GHP electives may not be
      comprehensive. 

      Students must take four additional elective courses in global health.
      Students may choose from an elective list that is curated and approved in
      advance every semester by the minor. In spring 2023 there were 60
      preapproved GHP electives, and in fall 2022 there were 38 preapproved GHP
      electives.

      Three of the four electives must be taken in junior or senior year.

      One elective may be taken in the first year or sophomore year.

      Students may petition to the minor for a course to be approved as a GHP
      elective prior to the start of the semester. Elective petitions will not
      be accepted after the start of the semester or after the course has been
      completed.

      Elective courses may be at the 200-, 300-, or 400 level. Students may
      petition to the minor for a 500-level course to be approved as a GHP
      elective on an individual basis. 100-level courses will not be approved as
      electives.

      A student may count a maximum of two 200-level courses toward the four
      elective total. If a cross- listed course carries both a 200- and
      300-level course number, it will count as a 200-level course for purposes
      of this requirement.

      At least one elective course must not be listed or cross-listed with the
      student's major.

      One course taken off-campus, including study abroad courses, may be taken
      as an elective with prior minor approval.

      One elective course may be taken on a PDF basis. Any course taken
      off-campus would count toward this limit.

      GHP students will complete an internship or research experience during the
      summer between junior and senior year. This provides students an
      opportunity to apply concepts from the core GHP courses and any electives
      taken to date in a real-world context. This experience must be full-time
      and must be a minimum of eight weeks in duration. The internship may be
      remote. All internships must be approved in advance by the minor.

      GHP students will write a senior thesis or research paper that addresses
      or relates to global health in an interdisciplinary manner. The
      requirement can be fulfilled in three ways, including a departmental
      thesis that fully integrates a global health topic; a final chapter added
      to a technical or lab-based thesis that connects the preceding content to
      a global health topic; or an original research paper on a global health
      topic.
