  The Program in Theater and Music Theater welcomes all students interested in
  exploring theater and music theater, with or without previous experience. We
  approach theater and music theater from a liberal arts perspectiveâ€” as
  intensely collaborative art forms, as key components of world cultures and as
  performance genres that shape and are shaped by history, economics, politics
  and technology. We research, study and perform theater, from classic plays,
  operas and musicals to contemporary, experimental and devised plays,
  performances and musicals. We offer a wide-ranging, innovative and
  student-initiated season of theatrical explorations, produced in collaboration
  with professional artists and craftspeople. Our season centers on
  community-building and the creation of original work, in which all students
  can participate, We encourage artistic and academic investigations of theater
  and music theater in conversation with every other area of study.

  At least one of the selected courses must have a dramaturgical or performance
  analysis (DPA) component. A list of current courses that would satisfy this
  requirement is made available annually through the program. This list is
  reviewed and updated annually by the program director and theater faculty.
  Additional courses may be proposed to the program director for approval to
  satisfy the DPA course. Senior year independent work for the minor is
  optional. While students may take THR 451 more than once, participation in THR
  451 can only count toward the minor once.
