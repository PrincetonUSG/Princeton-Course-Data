  Philosophy is of substantial relevance to work in a great variety of other
  academic subjects, many of which historically emerged originally as branches
  of philosophy before achieving the status of separate disciplines. The
  qualities of mind which the study of philosophy aims to cultivate, and which
  are most often cited by our alumni as their greatest benefit from majoring in
  the subject, including especially the ability to think and write in a clear
  and concise, organized and informed and disciplined way about contentious and
  often confusing issues, are likely to be of value in some way for virtually
  all students. The option of minoring in philosophy is intended to offer an
  opportunity to learn such lessons in a structured way, while leaving the
  student free to pursue virtually any major academic interest.

      Five courses in philosophy:

      None of which may be taken on a pass/D/fail basis.

      No more than one of which may be an approved cognate rather than a course
      listed or cross-listed with a PHI number.

      No more than two of which may be lower-division (200-level) courses, and
      no more than three of which may come from any single one of the four
      distribution areas into which philosophy courses are divided in the
      requirements for majors.

      No more than two of the five courses may be used to fulfill the
      requirements of the student's major.
