  The Program in East Asian Studies is an interdepartmental center directed by
  representatives of the cooperating departments — Anthropology, Art and
  Archaeology, Comparative Literature, East Asian Studies, Economics, History,
  Music, Politics, Religion, and Sociology — as well as the School of Public and
  International Affairs. It is designed to educate internationally minded
  students with basic competence in East Asia. The program provides an
  opportunity for students who plan to major in other disciplines to
  simultaneously pursue the study of East Asian language arts, history and other
  disciplines. East Asia is defined as those areas where Chinese, Korean, or
  Japanese is the dominant language, although courses and independent research
  in Vietnam may also be included as an area of study. The student's work is
  supervised by the appropriate representative of a cooperating department in
  consultation with the East Asian Studies program director.

          Cognate courses not cross-listed in the EAS Department that have more
          than half of their content about East Asia can also be applied for the
          minor. Examples include SOC 307/SPI308 Contemporary China, POL 434 The
          Political Economy of China, and SPI 316 China's Foreign Relations.
          Additional courses, including those taken abroad, may count toward the
          minor, but they must be approved in advance by the program office.

      In addition to the coursework, the student will submit a paper dealing
      with an area of East Asia, for which the use of East Asian language
      sources is strongly recommended. The student may submit the senior thesis
      or junior paper or substitute another substantial piece of original
      research that meets the same standards of relevance to East Asia.
