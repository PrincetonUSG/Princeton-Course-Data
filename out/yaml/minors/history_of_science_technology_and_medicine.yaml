description: >-
  From climate change to pandemics to the transformative effects of information
  technology, many of the challenges we confront today are inseparable from
  science, technology and medicine, whether as cause, explanation or remedy. To
  understand the role of STM in our present predicament and think through how it
  will shape our future, a historical perspective is vital. In the HSTM minor,
  students will learn from the array of methodological approaches developed by
  historians of science, technology and medicine, and track the evolution of
  modern science from antiquity to the present, in many of the world's cultures.
  For students majoring in the humanities and social sciences, the HSTM minor
  enhances their understanding of the content, methodologies and impacts of
  science, technology and medicine; in a complementary fashion, the HSTM minor
  provides students majoring in the natural sciences or engineering a richer
  appreciation of the social and cultural aspects of their fields, as well as
  the trajectories that brought their subjects to their present state.
