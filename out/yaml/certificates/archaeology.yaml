description: >-
  The Program in Archaeology is designed to provide students with an
  interdisciplinary foundation in archaeology — the study of the material
  remains of the past — and to equip students to use archaeological evidence in
  other fields of inquiry. The program offers courses that cover many cultures
  and periods, including Egypt, the Near East, Greece, Rome and the Americas. It
  encourages a deep integration of the humanities, the sciences and engineering,
  and promotes awareness of issues of cultural heritage. 

  In order to gain admission, a student must have taken any one of the courses
  offered by the program (see list below). Appropriate freshman seminars or
  writing seminars may fulfill the requirement, with the program director's
  approval.

    explanation: >-
      “Fieldwork” is not limited to excavation, although the program strongly
      encourages participation in a formal field school program. Sustained
      engagement in any aspect of an archaeological project fulfills the
      obligation. Students may, for example, assist in a geophysical survey,
      participate in a surface survey, work in archaeological archives, or
      intern for a zoologist. Fieldwork must be preapproved by the program
      director, last for at least four weeks, and include at least 100 hours of
      work. Financial support for fieldwork is available; to be immediately
      eligible, students must either be enrolled in the Program in Archaeology,
      or have taken at least two courses that count toward the certificate.
      Students who are not immediately eligible might be awarded financial
      support upon completion of an interview with the program director.

      Students take an additional four courses. Two courses must be approved as
      being in ancient area, at least one of which must be offered in the
      Department of Art and Archaeology in the ancient area (the “Group 1” for
      the history of art majors). Two other courses may or may not qualify as
      being ancient area, and at least one course must be outside of the
      Department of Art and Archaeology (see the list below). Approved freshman
      seminars may count toward the four courses. A freshman seminar taught by a
      faculty member in the Department of Art and Archaeology may not count for
      the required course outside of the department.

      Students undertake independent research, which may take one of three
      forms: (1) a senior thesis with a substantial archaeological component;
      (2) a junior paper on an archaeological topic; (3) a 25-page research
      paper on an archaeological topic.
