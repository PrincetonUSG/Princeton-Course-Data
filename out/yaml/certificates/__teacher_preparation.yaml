      In order to become well-rounded educators, program students are required
      to demonstrate proficiency in a variety of academic disciplines within the
      liberal arts and sciences curriculum. A course is required in each of the
      following areas: fine arts, humanities, mathematics, science and social
      science. Courses taken to fulfill the University distribution requirements
      will cover all of these areas except for fine arts.

    explanation: >-
      Teaching area requirements normally correspond to departmental major
      requirements. With careful choice of elective courses it is possible to be
      certified to teach in one field while majoring in another. A minimum of
      eight courses related to the area of certification are required, with
      three of the eight courses at the advanced level (300- or 400 level for
      all areas except mathematics, which requires three courses at the 200
      level or above). Specific areas of certification may include additional
      requirements or prescribed areas of study in the coursework, and students
      should consult the Teacher Prep Handbook for more information.
