  The Program in Judaic Studies provides students the opportunity to explore
  more than three millennia of Jewish culture, history, religion, thought,
  politics and literature from the Bible to contemporary Jewish thought and
  society. A wide variety of courses, lectures, conferences, film series and
  exhibitions taking advantage of Princeton's rich resources in Judaic studies
  are offered. There is no "typical" certificate student; we serve students with
  a wide range of interests and welcome all who are motivated to deepen their
  knowledge of Judaic studies.

  In order to receive the certificate, students may choose from the following
  two options: (1) take a minimum of five courses in Judaic studies, which must
  include JDS 202 Great Books of the Jewish Tradition and at least one course
  from the premodern period; or (2) take three courses to include JDS 202 Great
  Books of the Jewish Tradition and one course from the premodern period, plus
  write a senior thesis that draws significantly on some aspect of Judaic
  studies.
