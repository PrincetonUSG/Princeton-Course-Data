  The program is open to undergraduates in all departments. Students
  concentrating in Language and Literature departments, including Comparative
  Literature, as well as those pursuing Area Studies Certificates, will be
  eligible for the Program in Language and Culture provided that: (a) the
  linguistic base for the Language and Culture Certificate is different from the
  linguistic base of the concentration or the Area Studies Program, and (b) the
  work required for the Certificate in Language and Culture does not duplicate
  the requirements of the major or the Area Studies Program. For example,
  students majoring in Comparative Literature with French as their major foreign
  language cannot obtain a Certificate in French Language and Culture but can do
  so in Italian.

  PLEASE NOTE: Any French course taught in English will require all written work
  to be completed in French in order to count towards the certificate.

      A minimum of four departmental courses in the relevant language,
      linguistics, literature, or culture, excluding courses that do not have a
      language prerequisite and any 100-level language course. At least two of
      these courses must be at the 300 level (or higher). Up to two of these
      courses may be taken at the 200 level, but FRE 207 and 208 cannot both be
      counted. At the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, a
      student may substitute one course satisfactorily completed in a
      departmentally approved program of study abroad or one course taken in
      summer. A 200-level course is a prerequisite for taking 300-level courses
      in French. Please Note: Students pursuing a certificate in French may not
      count PDF or Audit courses toward the certificate. Those courses must be
      taken for a letter grade.

    explanation: >-
      A piece of written independent work displaying genuine intellectual
      commitment to the relevant language and culture. This important
      requirement can be satisfied in one of several ways, depending on the
      student's concentration and interest:

      a. Through a substantial paper on a topic agreed upon with the student's
      appointed adviser.

      b. Through a substantial paper growing out of one of the courses taken to
      fulfill the Certificate requirement. This paper will be in addition to the
      work required in the course. The subject and scope of this paper will be
      agreed upon with the student's appointed adviser.

      c. With the agreement of the student's home department, a student may
      submit a junior independent work (JP) or Senior Thesis that satisfies the
      requirements of both the home department and the Department of French and
      Italian. A JP or Senior Thesis of this sort should be based in substantial
      part on foreign language sources, and it should display competence in the
      language for which the student is requesting certification. Students
      interested in this option should consult our Director of Undergraduate
      Studies as early as possible to ensure that the paper or thesis will
      satisfy the Certificate requirements.

      Papers of types (a) and (b) are of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 words in
      length. Students are urged to compose them in the appropriate foreign
      language. If they choose not to do so, the paper must be prefaced by a
      700/1000-word précis in the foreign language. If students choose to
      compose their paper in French, the paper must be prefaced by a
      700/1000-word précis in English. The Independent Work can be rejected if
      these summaries are not written in grammatically correct, idiomatic
      French. This same requirement also applies to independent work of type
      (c).
