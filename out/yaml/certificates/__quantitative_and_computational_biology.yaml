  The Program in Quantitative and Computational Biology is offered by the
  Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics and its affiliated
  departments. The program is designed to instruct students in the theory and
  practice of using big data sets to achieve a quantitative understanding of
  complex biological processes. 

  Students are admitted to the program after they have chosen a major, joined a
  research lab and identified a project (with the help of the program committee
  if need be), and submitted a complete application by September 1 of their
  junior year. Although students are encouraged to find a lab on their own, the
  program committee will, if necessary, assist students in selecting a
  laboratory for their junior independent and senior thesis work. Students must
  have identified a lab and research project by the first day of their junior
  year fall semester. Admission requires the completion of prerequisites listed
  above. Program electives are chosen in consultation with the adviser.
