  The Program in Engineering Biology is designed for those highly motivated
  students who are interested in pursuing careers or graduate education in the
  areas of biotechnology or bioengineering. The interface between engineering
  and the life sciences is an area of dramatic growth and intellectual vigor.
  Innovations and new developments in this area require multidisciplinary
  approaches and an interdisciplinary understanding of engineering fundamentals
  as applied to living systems. For all students, the program offers a basic
  foundation in the language of living systems as well as an in-depth study of
  bioengineering fundamentals at multiple length scales.

      Three bioengineering courses, selected from the approved list available on
      the program website. These courses should provide a coherent training in
      an area of bioengineering, such as biotechnology, molecular or cellular
      engineering, neuro-engineering or systems biology. One of these courses
      must be from outside the student's major, and at least one of these
      courses must not count as a departmental.

      One advanced life science course, selected from the approved list
      available on the program website. This course should provide additional
      insight into complex living systems and complement the bioengineering
      courses chosen by the student.

      Close collaboration with faculty is expected. Students are required to
      complete, with the grade of B- or better, at least one semester of
      independent work in an appropriate area of engineering biology. This
      independent work is coordinated with the student's department in order to
      satisfy departmental requirements for the senior thesis or senior
      independent research.
