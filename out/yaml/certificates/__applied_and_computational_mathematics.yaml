  There has never been a better time to be a mathematician. The combination of
  mathematics and computer modeling has transformed science and engineering and
  is changing the nature of research in the biological sciences, data science
  and many other areas. Students seeking to pursue an academic program with a
  strong focus on applied mathematics may major in mathematics with a course of
  study geared toward applications, or may major in the sciences or engineering
  and enroll in the certificate Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics
  (PACM).

      A total of five courses, normally 300-level or higher (requires letter
      grade; pass/D/fail not accepted), at least two of which are not included
      in the usual requirements for the candidate's major.

      The course requirement may be satisfied by a broad range of courses that
      place a particular emphasis on applied mathematics, which are offered by
      the mathematics department as well as the science, engineering and
      economics departments. The five required courses must be distributed
      between the following two areas, with at least two from each area: 

      1. Mathematical foundations and techniques, including differential
      equations, real and complex analysis, discrete mathematics, probability,
      numerical methods, etc. 

      2. Mathematical applications in diverse areas offered by the applied and
      computational mathematics program and by science, engineering and
      economics departments.

  - name: Independent Work
    max_counted: 1
    explanation: >-
      Independent work consisting of a paper in one of the following formats:
      (a) a project that you are working on with a professor; or (b) a summer
      research project. However, the independent work may not be used to satisfy
      any requirements of your major or of any other minor or certificate. In
      particular, you may not use your junior paper or senior thesis to satisfy
      the independent work requirement for the certificate. A significant
      extension of the senior thesis or of a course project may however be used
      to satisfy the requirement, subject to approval of the PACM undergraduate
      representative.

      Students are required to participate during the spring semester of their
      junior and senior years in a not-for-credit colloquium offered by PACM.
      This will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of independent
      work among all certificate students and will introduce them to a broad
      range of areas within applied mathematics.
