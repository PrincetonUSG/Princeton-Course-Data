      Fulfill a language requirement by doing one of the following:

      Take a 200- or 300-level course in a European language.

      Demonstrate fluency in a European language by taking a test administered
      by the program. Any national language spoken in a European country may be
      used to satisfy the requirement. The expectation is that students will
      have sufficient linguistic competence to use research materials in the
      language for their senior thesis research.
