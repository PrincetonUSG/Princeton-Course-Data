  The Program in Architecture and Engineering facilitates certificate studies
  from any student and is designed to support the full range of engineering and
  architectural cross-disciplinary interests. This program is a framework for
  interdisciplinary study to tackle problems that cannot be addressed by one
  discipline. Completion of the certificate program provides an opportunity to
  respond dynamically to evolving global challenges, where elegant and effective
  solutions lead to more resilient and sustainable communities.

      One course is required within a "field of expertise" chosen by the
      student:

      Structures: CEE 262 (A or B) Structures and the Urban Environment

      Computation: ARC 311 Building Science and Tech: Building Systems, or
      alternative approved by co-directors

      Environment: ENE202 Designing Sustainable Systems

      Note: With approval of the committee, the student may construct their own
      “field of expertise” that demonstrates a coherent program of study
      addressing a global challenge theme.

      Three additional courses are selected from a list of approved electives in
      each field of expertise. The preapproved courses within each field of
      expertise are listed below.

      In addition to course requirements, the student must identify a global
      challenge theme, and incorporate the theme into the senior thesis as
      described below.

      Identify a Global Challenge Theme: The solutions to modern societal
      challenges can be elegant, as well as effective. Together, architects and
      engineers must take the lead in confronting new societal challenges for
      designing more resilient and sustainable communities.

      Incorporate Theme in Senior Thesis: The senior thesis should address a
      cross-disciplinary theme relevant to a global challenge. The student
      should also contribute to a thesis colloquium. The subject should be
      reviewed and approved by the co-directors.
