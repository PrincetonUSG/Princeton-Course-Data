Similarly, technology does not develop in a vacuum; by virtue of its applied nature, it is shaped by the needs and desires of individuals and the societies in which they live. Society and technology co-evolve, so that you cannot fully understand one without knowing something about the other. This cross-disciplinary certificate program is targeted to students, both engineers/scientists and humanists/social scientists, who are interested in exploring this intersection in depth. Graduates who earn this certificate will be effective contributors to the shaping, development and deployment of technological solutions for the benefit of society.\nStudents must select either the Information Technology track or the Energy track and take the technology, societal and breadth courses from the respective list of courses.","max_common_with_major":"ALL","declaration_limit":8,"pdfs_allowed":1,"req_list":[{"name":"Core Course","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"Technology and Society (EGR 277/HIS 277/SOC 277).

For A.B. students, this includes a junior paper. This may be substituted by a significant component in their senior thesis (at least a chapter).

The project/thesis component requires preapproval from the student's program adviser.\nAnnual Symposium. Students are required to present their projects/theses to the program students and faculty at an annual symposium held in the spring. This provides a mechanism for shared learning as well as for developing the common themes across the program.","iw_relationship":"hybrid","no_req":null}]}
