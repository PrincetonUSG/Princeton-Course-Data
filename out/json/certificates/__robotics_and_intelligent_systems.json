Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, in topics that may not be covered by a single department. The program offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest and setting the stage for further achievement. Students are encouraged to expand their experience through summer internships with companies, government agencies and university laboratories.","max_common_with_major":"ALL","declaration_limit":7,"pdfs_allowed":0,"req_list":[{"name":"Prerequisites","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"explanation":"This program is open to juniors and seniors who have a satisfactory background in mathematics, science and computing.
