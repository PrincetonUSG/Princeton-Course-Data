The rapidly developing field of finance focuses on the pricing of financial assets, including equities, bonds, currencies and derivative securities; portfolio management and the evaluation of financial risks; banking and financial intermediation; the financing of corporations; corporate governance; financial market and banking regulation; and many other topics. In addition to the obvious practical relevance of finance, the field contains both challenging intellectual problems and a distinctive formal framework within which those problems can be addressed. Knowledge of modern finance is also essential to the proper understanding of many other topics in economics and public policy, including the determination of exchange rates and international capital flows, the making of monetary and fiscal policy, the role of financial reform in developing and transition economies, the regulation and taxation of financial markets and financial instruments, and antitrust policy. Finally, modern finance is remarkably eclectic, drawing from many disciplines besides economics, including mathematics, operations research, engineering, computer science, psychology, politics and history.","declaration_limit":4,"pdfs_allowed":0,"req_list":[{"name":"Prerequisites","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"explanation":"As economic theory, mathematics, and probability and statistics are pervasive in modern financial analysis, completion of the finance minor requires mathematical ability and preparation. The following foundation courses are required for admission into the program and (except as noted) must be completed by the end of sophomore year. All courses require a letter grade (pass/D/fail not allowed). Students are required to take courses in mathematics, economics and probability and statistics as follows:","req_list":[{"name":"Mathematics","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"(a) MAT175; (b) MAT201 and MAT202 or equivalent EGR154 and EGR156; or (c) MAT203 and MAT204.

Students who choose to fulfill this requirement by taking the one-semester MAT 175 will be responsible for mastering the linear algebra part of the curriculum on their own.","req_list":[{"name":"MAT 175","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"course_list":["MAT 175"]},{"name":"MAT/EGR","min_needed":"ALL","max_counted":1,"req_list":[{"name":"Multivariable Calculus","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"course_list":["EGR 154","MAT 201","MAT 203"]},{"name":"Linear Algebra","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"course_list":["EGR 156","MAT 202","MAT 204"]}]}]},{"name":"Economics","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"ECO300 OR ECO 310 (Microeconomic Theory)","course_list":["ECO 300","ECO 310"]},{"name":"Probability and Statistics","min_needed":1,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"ORF 245 (Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics), or ECO 202 (Statistics and Data Analysis for Economics), or PSY 251 (Quantitative Methods), or SOC 301 (Sociological Research Methods), or POL 345 (Quantitative Analysis and Politics), or SPI 200 (Statistics for Social Science).
