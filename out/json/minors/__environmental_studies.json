Our guiding ethos is grounded in the appreciation that environmental challenges — both present and future — cannot be solved by any one discipline alone, but require concerted, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts, spanning all four divisions of the university. To that end, the program is designed to attract students from all disciplinary backgrounds and with varied interests, and to allow them to tailor their learning while also ensuring that they are exposed to fundamental environmental questions and methods/approaches through a variety of complementary lenses. In that sense, the ENV certificate — and, if approved, the minor — is designed to complement majors and not overlap or compete with them: specifically, it aims to provide a much broader multidisciplinary lens than any individual department or even individual division could.","max_common_with_major":1,"declaration_limit":5,"double_counting_allowed":true,"req_list":[{"name":"Program of Study","min_needed":"ALl","max_counted":1,"explanation":"The Minor in Environmental Studies is open to students concentrating in any academic discipline and designed for students seeking a broad, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary introduction to environmental topics. To be eligible for the minor, students are required to complete two (2) foundational courses, at least one of which is at or above the 300 level, and three (3) elective courses, at least two of which are at or above the 300 level. Two of the total five (5) courses must be in humanities and/or social sciences and two must be in natural sciences and engineering. No more than one (1) course filling the requirement for the ENV minor may also be counted toward the student's departmental concentration or another minor/certificate.
