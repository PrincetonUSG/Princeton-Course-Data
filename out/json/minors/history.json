Through coursework and a research paper, students learn how to pose historical questions, how to build answers by analyzing historical evidence in context, how to evaluate existing interpretations of the past, and how to write persuasively and elegantly. The department's courses explore a wide variety of regions, themes and periods, and history minors have the flexibility to undertake a broad range of inquiry or to pursue a specific passion in depth. No matter which pathway they choose, though, history minors develop key critical thinking skills. They foster empathy for different perspectives and gain new insight into the diversity of human experience. And they learn to research and debate how and why societies change over time, as well as how prior eras have helped to produce our own. By becoming more informed students of the past, history minors improve their ability to scrutinize the present and to thoughtfully shape the future.","max_common_with_major":1,"declaration_limit":6,"pdfs_allowed":null,"excluded_majors":["HIS"],"excluded_minors":["HOS"],"req_list":[{"name":"Program of Study","min_needed":5,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"Students are required to complete five history courses. These courses may range broadly across regions, themes and time periods, or they may be focused on a single area of study. Upon declaring their interest in a history minor, students will articulate their goals and plan an individualized pathway to the minor in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Program for History. \nInterested history minors may apply to take the junior seminar for majors (HIS400) during the fall or spring of junior year or fall of senior year. For minors enrolled in HIS 400, the course requirements are standard except that the research paper written for the course will be slightly shorter than the length required for majors.

The research paper will normally be written for a HIS course and revised as needed to meet the requirements of the minor. In addition, students will submit a 500-word methodological reflection on the research and writing process. The undergraduate program director for history will review the submitted work and verify that it satisfies departmental requirements.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null}]}
