  The Program in Engineering Biology is designed for those highly 
  motivated students who are interested in pursuing careers or graduate 
  education in the areas of biotechnology or bioengineering. The 
  interface between engineering and the life sciences is an area of 
  dramatic growth and intellectual vigor. Innovations and new 
  developments in this area require multidisciplinary approaches 
  and an interdisciplinary understanding of engineering fundamentals 
  as applied to living systems. For all students, the program offers a 
  basic foundation in the language of living systems as well as an 
  in-depth study of bioengineering fundamentals at multiple length scales.
