  The program is open to all undergraduates in all departments. Ordinarily,
  students majoring in language and literature departments, including
  comparative literature, will be eligible for the certificate in language and
  culture provided that: (a) the linguistic base for the language and culture
  certificate is different from the linguistic base of the major; and (b) the
  work required for the language and culture certificate does not duplicate the
  requirements of the major.

      Three department-based POR courses above the 100-level on the literature
      and cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world. At least one of these three
      courses must be at the 200-level. No course taught in English can count
      towards the certificate. Courses must be taken for a letter grade, no
      Pass/D/Fail or Audit. **Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, spring '20 and
      academic year '20-'21 courses taken PDF will be accepted.**  At the
      discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students who study
      abroad during the academic year may count one pre-approved course per
      semester abroad towards the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad
      course offered through the department would also count, provided that it
      is taught in Portuguese. Two pre-approved courses in a summer program
      abroad other than Princeton's can count as one course towards the
      certificate, provided that they are taught in Portuguese. In no case,
      however, can more than one course taken abroad count towards the
      certificate.

      During their senior year, students are required to submit a paper on a
      designated topic. The paper must be written in Portuguese; be at least
      6,000 words in length; and be an extension of a paper written for one of
      the courses taken towards the certificate. Advisers are not assigned. One
      additional upper-division POR course (above the 100-level) may be
      substituted for the independent work.
