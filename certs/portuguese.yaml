  The program is open to all undergraduates in all departments. 
  Ordinarily, students majoring in language and literature departments, 
  including comparative literature, will be eligible for the certificate 
  in language and culture provided that: (a) the linguistic base for 
  the language and culture certificate is different from the linguistic 
  base of the major; and (b) the work required for the language and 
  culture certificate does not duplicate the requirements of the major.
