  There has never been a better time to be a mathematician. 
  The combination of mathematics and computer modeling has 
  transformed science and engineering and is changing the nature of 
  research in the biological sciences, data science and many other areas. 
  Students seeking to pursue an academic program with a strong focus on 
  applied mathematics may major in mathematics with a course of study 
  geared toward applications, or may major in the sciences or 
  engineering and enroll in the certificate Program in Applied and 
  Computational Mathematics (PACM).
