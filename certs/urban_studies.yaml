  The Program in Urban Studies is an interdepartmental plan of study for undergraduates that offers an interdisciplinary framework for the study of cities, metropolitan regions, and urban and suburban landscapes. With courses in diverse departments including anthropology, architecture, art and archaeology, history, African American studies, English, Latin American studies, Spanish and Portuguese languages and cultures, civil and environmental engineering, energy studies, sociology, politics, theater, and the High Meadows Environmental Institute, along with the School of Architecture and the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the program encourages students to think about metropolitan centers in all their complexity as physical spaces; social, cultural, political and economic nexuses; and historical artifacts.
