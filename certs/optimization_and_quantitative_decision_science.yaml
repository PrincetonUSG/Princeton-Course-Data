  The Certificate Program in Optimization and Quantitative Decision 
  Science (OQDS) is focused on developing quantitative skills for 
  optimal decision-making in complex and uncertain environments. 
  Through this certificate program, students will learn to quantify 
  risk and uncertainty, and to view any complex decision through the 
  lens of mathematical optimization. This outlook will give them a 
  more structured understanding of the decision itself, as they learn 
  to rigorously formulate their constraints, objective functions(s) 
  and the uncertainties involved. It will also lead students to the 
  proper algorithmic tools that are needed to arrive at an optimal decision.
