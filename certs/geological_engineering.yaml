description: |-
  Geological engineering is the application of science to problems 
  involving the Earth, its physical environment, Earth materials and 
  natural resources. Geological engineering problems are increasingly 
  important to humankind, and the well-trained Earth scientist-engineer 
  will be uniquely positioned to solve these problems and find the best 
  ways to use Earth's resources while protecting the environment. 
  For example, the geological engineer is involved with exploration
  and use of Earth's water, energy and mineral resources, as well 
  as in the acquisition and utilization of the data necessary to shape 
  environmental policy and practice. Princeton's Program in Geological 
  Engineering combines studies in engineering and Earth sciences, with 
  focus on applications of geology, geochemistry and geophysics.
