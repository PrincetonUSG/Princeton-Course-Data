description: |-
  Geological engineering is the application of science to problems involving the Earth, its physical environment, Earth materials and natural resources. Geological engineering problems are increasingly important to humankind, and the well-trained Earth scientist-engineer will be uniquely positioned to solve these problems and find the best ways to use Earth's resources while protecting the environment. For example, the geological engineer is involved with exploration and use of Earth's water, energy and mineral resources, as well as in the acquisition and utilization of the data necessary to shape environmental policy and practice. Princeton's Program in Geological Engineering combines studies in engineering and Earth sciences, with focus on applications of geology, geochemistry and geophysics.
