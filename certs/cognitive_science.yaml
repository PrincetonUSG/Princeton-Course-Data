  Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of how the mind works, 
  drawing on research from psychology, philosophy, linguistics, 
  neuroscience and computer science. The interdisciplinary character 
  of cognitive science is reflected in its reliance on many different 
  levels of analysis of mental phenomena and its employment of a variety 
  of methodologies appropriate to each level. The goal of cognitive 
  science is to integrate the insights from multiple disciplines and 
  modes of research into a unified scientific account of the mind and 
  its place in nature. Research in cognitive science includes, but is 
  not limited to, work on psychophysics, perception, linguistics and 
  language processing, philosophy of mind and language, cognitive 
  development, memory, reasoning, emotion, moral and social cognition, 
  and judgment and decision making. One ambition of cognitive science 
  is to understand just how mental abilities and processes are realized 
  in the brain, and how such neural realizations can ground the conscious, 
  deliberate activity of thought and decision. Another is to map out 
  just how the human mind develops from childhood on, and thereby
   articulate the deep mechanisms of learning and cognitive development. 
   A third ambition is to investigate just how far mental processes 
   can be duplicated in complex computational structures that could be 
   instantiated in machines.
