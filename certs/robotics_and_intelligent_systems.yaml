description: |-
  New industries and organizations depend increasingly on the interplay between engineering, computing and the life sciences. Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, in topics that may not be covered by a single department. The program offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest and setting the stage for further achievement. Students are encouraged to expand their experience through summer internships with companies, government agencies and university laboratories.
