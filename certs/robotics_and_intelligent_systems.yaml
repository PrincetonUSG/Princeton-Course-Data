description: |-
  New industries and organizations depend increasingly on the 
  interplay between engineering, computing and the life sciences. 
  Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches 
  and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, 
  in topics that may not be covered by a single department. The program 
  offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing 
  students to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields 
  of interest and setting the stage for further achievement. Students 
  are encouraged to expand their experience through summer internships 
  with companies, government agencies and university laboratories.
