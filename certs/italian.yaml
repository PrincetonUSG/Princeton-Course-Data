description: |-
  The program is open to undergraduates in all departments. 
  Students concentrating in Language and Literature departments, 
  including Comparative Literature, as well as those pursuing Area 
  Studies Certificates, will be eligible for the Program in Language 
  and Culture provided that: (a) the linguistic base for the Language 
  and Culture Certificate is different from the linguistic base of the 
  concentration or the Area Studies Program, and (b) the work required 
  for the Certificate in Language and Culture does not duplicate the 
  requirements of the major or the Area Studies Program. For example, 
  students majoring in Comparative Literature with French as their major 
  foreign language cannot obtain a Certificate in French Language and 
  Culture but can do so in Italian.
