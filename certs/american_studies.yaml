  The Program in American Studies, administered by the Effron Center 
  for the Study of America, is an interdisciplinary plan of study that 
  prepares students to make intellectual connections in the world 
  through the experiences and place of America in current and historical 
  times. Encompassing a wide range of fields, areas and disciplines, 
  and grounded in the histories and experiences of the diverse peoples 
  and cultures that make up the United States of America, the program 
  explores different conceptual framings of America and the role of 
  the United States in local, global and transnational relationships. 
  By asking a broad range of research questions and engaging with 
  diverse scholarly methods and theories, the program encourages new 
  understandings of issues that profoundly affect contemporary life 
  and scholarship, including questions of migration, diaspora and borders; 
  indigeneity and colonization; globalization, empire and war; capital 
  and culture; language, race and ethnicity; religion; slavery and 
  racialization; gender and sexuality; and ecology and technology.
