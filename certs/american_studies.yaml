  The Program in American Studies, administered by the Effron Center for the
  Study of America, is an interdisciplinary plan of study that prepares students
  to make intellectual connections in the world through the experiences and
  place of America in current and historical times. Encompassing a wide range of
  fields, areas and disciplines, and grounded in the histories and experiences
  of the diverse peoples and cultures that make up the United States of America,
  the program explores different conceptual framings of America and the role of
  the United States in local, global and transnational relationships. By asking
  a broad range of research questions and engaging with diverse scholarly
  methods and theories, the program encourages new understandings of issues that
  profoundly affect contemporary life and scholarship, including questions of
  migration, diaspora and borders; indigeneity and colonization; globalization,
  empire and war; capital and culture; language, race and ethnicity; religion;
  slavery and racialization; gender and sexuality; and ecology and technology.
