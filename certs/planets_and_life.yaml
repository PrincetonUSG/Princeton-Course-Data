  Unraveling the origins of life on Earth and determining whether 
  life exists beyond Earth will likely be two of the most significant 
  scientific discoveries in the 21st century. The Program in Planets 
  and Life is an interdepartmental, multidisciplinary plan of study 
  designed for students interested in these two questions. The goal 
  is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamental 
  astrophysical, chemical, biological and geological principles and 
  engineering challenges that will guide our search for life in 
  extreme environments on Earth and on other planets and satellites 
  in the solar system and among neighboring planetary systems. 
  Research on and teaching of these topics are typically performed 
  under the rubric of astrobiology.
