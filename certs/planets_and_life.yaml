  Unraveling the origins of life on Earth and determining whether life exists
  beyond Earth will likely be two of the most significant scientific discoveries
  in the 21st century. The Program in Planets and Life is an interdepartmental,
  multidisciplinary plan of study designed for students interested in these two
  questions. The goal is to provide students with an understanding of the
  fundamental astrophysical, chemical, biological and geological principles and
  engineering challenges that will guide our search for life in extreme
  environments on Earth and on other planets and satellites in the solar system
  and among neighboring planetary systems. Research on and teaching of these
  topics are typically performed under the rubric of astrobiology.

      Students must take the core course GEO 255/AST 255/EEB 255/CHM 255. This
      course will qualify for departmental credit if the student submits a
      25-page term paper on astrobiology, with the emphasis in that department's
      discipline.

      Students must take an additional four cognate courses. Only two of the
      cognate courses can be in the student's major or be requirements of their
      majors (though exceptions can be considered on a case-by-case basis). The
      cognate courses must be approved by the program chairperson, and students
      are encouraged to discuss their choices in the early stages of their
      planning.

      To qualify for the certificate, A.B. students must (a) write at least one
      of the junior papers on an astrobiology topic and, as part of the senior
      thesis, (b) devote a chapter to an astrobiology topic — both of them
      subject to approval by the program director in consultation with executive
      committee members. Engineering students must devote one chapter of their
      senior independent work to an astrobiology topic — again subject to
      approval by the program chairperson in consultation with executive
      committee members. The relevant content of the student's senior thesis or
      senior independent work will be presented at a special Planets and Life
      Symposium at the end of senior year. Juniors are also encouraged to
      participate in this yearly Planets and Life Symposium.
