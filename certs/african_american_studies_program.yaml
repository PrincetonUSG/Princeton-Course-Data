description: |-
  The Program in African American Studies was founded on the assumption 
  that the study of African American history and culture, and of the 
  role that race has played in shaping the life and the institutions 
  of the United States, is central to an American liberal education. 
  Given the continuing and evolving centrality of race in American 
  political, economic, social and cultural life, and indeed, in every 
  region of the world, reflection on race and on the distinctive 
  experiences of Black people is indispensable for all Princeton 
  students as global citizens. Drawing on a core of distinguished 
  faculty in areas such as art and archaeology, comparative 
  literature, English, history, philosophy, law and political science, 
  psychology, religion and sociology, the program promotes teaching and 
  research of race with a focus on the experience of African Americans 
  in the United States. AAS offers an undergraduate certificate that 
  expands and deepens a student's understanding of race in the 
  United States and in the world. Earning a certificate is 
  straightforward and allows students to experience an enriching 
  course of study that complements any Princeton major. Students who 
  opt to pursue a certificate gain access to an extraordinary 
  bibliography that prepares them to think about race and power 
  in sophisticated ways. Students are trained in the methods, 
  themes and ideas that inform interdisciplinary scholarship, with 
  a particular focus on race and racial inequality.
