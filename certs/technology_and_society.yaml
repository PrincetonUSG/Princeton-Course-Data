  One would be hard-pressed to find any aspect of society today that is 
  not influenced by evolving technology in a significant way. 
  Similarly, technology does not develop in a vacuum; by virtue of 
  its applied nature, it is shaped by the needs and desires of 
  individuals and the societies in which they live. Society and 
  technology co-evolve, so that you cannot fully understand one 
  without knowing something about the other. This cross-disciplinary 
  certificate program is targeted to students, both engineers/scientists 
  and humanists/social scientists, who are interested in exploring this 
  intersection in depth. Graduates who earn this certificate will be 
  effective contributors to the shaping, development and deployment of 
  technological solutions for the benefit of society.
