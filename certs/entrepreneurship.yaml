  Entrepreneurship the Princeton Way is defined as follows: 
  You are an entrepreneur any time you pursue societal impact 
  through broadly sustainable value creation. Entrepreneurship is 
  driving enormous social and economic changes that are shaping our 
  collective future. The program has three main aims: to create focused
  pathways through the curriculum that will allow Princeton 
  undergraduates to supplement work in their major departments with 
  a systematic and coherent understanding of, and practice in, 
  entrepreneurship; to leverage, expand and enhance the University's 
  offerings across the liberal arts in order to fulfill the previously 
  stated aim; and to promote an interdisciplinary academic community of 
  undergraduate students, faculty members and others who share an 
  interest in and commitment to learning from and contributing to 
  these areas.
