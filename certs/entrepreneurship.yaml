  Entrepreneurship the Princeton Way is defined as follows: You are an entrepreneur any time you pursue societal impact through broadly sustainable value creation.
  Entrepreneurship is driving enormous social and economic changes that are shaping our collective future. The program has three main aims: to create focused pathways through the curriculum that will allow Princeton undergraduates to supplement work in their major departments with a systematic and coherent understanding of, and practice in, entrepreneurship; to leverage, expand and enhance the University's offerings across the liberal arts in order to fulfill the previously stated aim; and to promote an interdisciplinary academic community of undergraduate students, faculty members and others who share an interest in and commitment to learning from and contributing to these areas.
