  The Program in European Cultural Studies (ECS) was established in 
  1975 on the joint initiative of faculty members in history, 
  comparative literature, romance languages and literatures, politics 
  and architecture, under the leadership of the eminent cultural 
  historian Carl E. Schorske (1915-2015). Its first certificate class 
  graduated in 1979. Now housed on the second floor of Scheide Caldwell 
  House within the Andlinger Center for the Humanities, ECS enjoys the 
  administrative support of the Council of the Humanities. Committed 
  since its founding to encouraging students' engagement at an 
  international level, ECS now also endeavors to situate the study of 
  Europe in broader global contexts.
