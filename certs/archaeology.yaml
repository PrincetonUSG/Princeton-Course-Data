  The Program in Archaeology is designed to provide students with an 
  interdisciplinary foundation in archaeology — the study of the material 
  remains of the past — and to equip students to use archaeological 
  evidence in other fields of inquiry. The program offers courses 
  that cover many cultures and periods, including Egypt, the Near 
  East, Greece, Rome and the Americas. It encourages a deep 
  integration of the humanities, the sciences and engineering, 
  and promotes awareness of issues of cultural heritage.
