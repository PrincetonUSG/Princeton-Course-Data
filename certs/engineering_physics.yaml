  Interdisciplinary areas in physical sciences in engineering such as 
  energy, environment, materials, microelectronics, astronautics and 
  photonics promise to become increasingly relevant in the 21st century. 
  The Program in Engineering Physics, which provides students with a 
  fundamental knowledge of physics, together with problem-solving skills 
  and an understanding of engineering, is designed to address the needs 
  of students seeking innovative careers in today's technological age. 
  In addition, it allows students to keep their options open between 
  physical sciences and engineering. Following completion of the 
  engineering physics program, students typically enter careers in 
  engineering, applied science or applied physics through research, 
  teaching or entrepreneurial engineering. Past graduates have also 
  pursued other careers as diverse as medicine, business and law.
