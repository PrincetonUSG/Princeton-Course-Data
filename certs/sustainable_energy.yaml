description: >-
  The future of societies, the global economy and the global environment depend
  on collaborative research into renewable energy, alternative fuels, advanced
  energy conversion and storage systems, technology transfer to developing
  countries and prudent judgment on policies to support sustainable energy
  technology. Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches
  and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, in topics
  that are not covered by a single department. The Program in Sustainable Energy
  offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students to
  fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest, gaining
  laboratory and site visit experiences and setting the stage for further work
  in the field. Students are encouraged to expand their experience through
  summer internships with companies, government agencies, national and
  university laboratories and Princeton faculty.

      The program is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors who have a
      satisfactory background in engineering and science. Normally, students
      should have successfully completed MAT 103, MAT 104, PHY 103, and PHY 104
      (or their equivalents, including AP equivalents). Students who have
      slightly different preparation should consult with the program director to
      discuss eligibility. Students planning to earn the program certificate
      should complete the online student profile at the program website as early
      as possible, but no later than the midpoint of the fall term of their
      junior year. Application for admission is made to the program committee.
      Upon acceptance to the program, the program director will recommend a
      program adviser to the student to assist in planning a program of study,
      research and off-campus internship.
