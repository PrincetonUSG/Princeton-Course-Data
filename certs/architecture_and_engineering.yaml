description: |-
  The Program in Architecture and Engineering facilitates certificate studies from any student and is designed to support the full range of engineering and architectural cross-disciplinary interests. This program is a framework for interdisciplinary study to tackle problems that cannot be addressed by one discipline. Completion of the certificate program provides an opportunity to respond dynamically to evolving global challenges, where elegant and effective solutions lead to more resilient and sustainable communities.
