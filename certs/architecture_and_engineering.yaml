description: |-
  The Program in Architecture and Engineering facilitates certificate 
  studies from any student and is designed to support the full range 
  of engineering and architectural cross-disciplinary interests. 
  This program is a framework for interdisciplinary study to tackle 
  problems that cannot be addressed by one discipline. Completion of 
  the certificate program provides an opportunity to respond dynamically 
  to evolving global challenges, where elegant and effective solutions 
  lead to more resilient and sustainable communities.
