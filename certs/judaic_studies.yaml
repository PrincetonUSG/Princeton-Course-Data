description: |-
  The Program in Judaic Studies provides students the opportunity to 
  explore more than three millennia of Jewish culture, history, 
  religion, thought, politics and literature from the Bible to 
  contemporary Jewish thought and society. A wide variety of courses, 
  lectures, conferences, film series and exhibitions taking advantage of 
  Princeton's rich resources in Judaic studies are offered. There is 
  no "typical" certificate student; we serve students with a wide 
  range of interests and welcome all who are motivated to deepen their 
  knowledge of Judaic studies.
