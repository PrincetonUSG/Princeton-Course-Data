  A certificate in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures offers evidence 
  to prospective employers and graduate programs that a student has 
  achieved competence in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, or Hebrew.
  Students may earn a certificate in language and culture whether 
  or not they are NES majors. Students wishing to receive one or more 
  certificates in language and culture must email Mr. James LaRegina, 
  the NES undergraduate administrator, at laregina@princeton.edu by 
  March 1 of their senior year to verify that they have completed the 
  requirements and arrange to receive the certificate.
