  A certificate in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures offers evidence to
  prospective employers and graduate programs that a student has achieved
  competence in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, or Hebrew.

  Students may earn a certificate in language and culture whether or not they
  are NES majors. Students wishing to receive one or more certificates in
  language and culture must email Mr. James LaRegina, the NES undergraduate
  administrator, at laregina@princeton.edu by March 1 of their senior year to
  verify that they have completed the requirements and arrange to receive the
  certificate.

      NOTE: This requirement must be manually verified as it is highly dependent
      on the chosen language and individual course content.

      Complete at least three NES courses in language, literature or culture
      that involve extensive use of the designated language at the third-year or
      higher level.

      Complete a substantial piece of independent research (i.e., a paper of
      7,000 words or more).  Students must find a language instructor or other
      faculty member who agrees to review their independent work. This
      independent research requirement, due on  Dean's Date, may be satisfied in
      one of the following ways:

      A paper growing out of one of the courses taken to fulfill the certificate
      requirements. This paper should be additional to the work required in the
      course.

      A paper on a topic agreed upon with an instructor in the
      department.          

      With the agreement of the student's home department and the Department of
      Near Eastern Studies, a student may be allowed to complete a piece of
      independent work that will satisfy the requirements of both the home
      department and the certificate. For example, a student could write a
      junior paper or senior thesis based in substantial part on Near Eastern
      language sources. The paper does not have to be based entirely on Near
      Eastern language sources, but its use of such sources should not be
      trivial or amount to mere window-dressing. In other words, the paper
      should demonstrate that the insights derived from Near Eastern language
      sources reach beyond those gained from other sources.
