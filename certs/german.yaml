description: |-
  The Department of German offers students an opportunity to do 
  sustained work in German language, literature, philosophy, art, 
  and media while majoring in another department, leading to a 
  Certificate in German Language and Culture. Certificate students 
  can choose from the broad range of German Department courses taught 
  in both English and German. Classes extend from the Middle Ages to 
  the contemporary moment, introduce diverse disciplinary perspectives 
  including art history and philosophy, and engage with multiple critical 
  paradigms, such as gender and media studies. Through vibrant classroom 
  discussions and close advising relationships, the certificate program 
  engages students who wish to advance their command of the German 
  language and deepen their understanding of German culture.
