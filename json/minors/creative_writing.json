These courses are designed, first and foremost, to teach the students how to read like a writer, thoughtfully, artistically, curiously, with an open mind attuned to the nuances of any human situation. This skill is not only for students who plan to be professional writers, but most important, this is a skill we believe to be crucial for all students. The many courses offered by the creative writing department teach students how to structure a narrative and write it well; how to use lived experience in the compressed linguistic construct of a poem so that it provides a meaningful experience for a reader; how to think about, and undertake, the translation of a literary work into another literary work in another language; how to write and adapt literary narratives for a variety of screen media.","max_common_with_major":null,"declaration_limit":6,"pdfs_allowed":0,"req_list":[{"name":"Prerequisites","min_needed":5,"max_counted":1,"completed_by_semester":6,"explanation":"For the minor program, our goal is to guide students through a course of study that begins with introductory courses, and then combines courses at advanced levels with cross-listed and approved courses offered by other units. The minor in creative writing includes a total of five courses, three of which must be housed in creative writing, and two which may be cross-listed with creative writing. To be eligible to apply for the minor, students must have taken the five courses as described below by the end of their junior year. Senior year is focused on development of students' independent work.","req_list":[{"name":"CWR Departmentals","min_needed":3,"max_counted":1,"course_list":["CWR ***"]},{"name":"CWR Crosslists","min_needed":0,"max_counted":2,"no_crosslist":null,"course_list":["CWR ***"]}]},{"name":"Independent Work","max_counted":1,"explanation":"Students admitted to the minor program will have one year of one-on-one thesis work with an established poet or prose writer. This independent work includes weekly or biweekly conferences with the thesis advisers for two semesters. Under the direction of the thesis advisers, the students will produce a full-length collection of poetry, a collection of short stories or a finished novel manuscript. Each final thesis is read by another writer, who provides a thoughtful and detailed commentary, which gives a snapshot of the student's career and offers future direction. This independent thesis work has long been a treasured tradition of the creative writing program, and we believe that the conversion to the minor program will more accurately reflect the amount of work both the students and the advisers have put in during their senior year. Apart from independent work, the students will also participate in two public readings â€” a reading of their work-in-progress with their peers alongside a published writer, and a thesis reading, a celebration of their final theses. An unofficial monthly lunch meeting for the thesis cohort, directed by an appointed faculty member, will serve as a support group.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null}]}
