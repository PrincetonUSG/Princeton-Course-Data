Marshall","email":"sm9@princeton.edu"}],"description":"The Program in Dance (link is external), part of the Lewis Center for the Arts (link is external), welcomes all students to engage and experiment with dance. At the core of the program is the belief that dance fosters an integration of mind and body that allows for a greater connection to ourselves and our communities. To that end, the dance minor offers students deep exposure to and appreciation of dance through practice, performance and critical conversation.","declaration_limit":5,"req_list":[{"name":"Program of Study","min_needed":5,"max_counted":1,"explanation":"Students should enroll in the minor program during the second term of sophomore year, but no later than the start of the first term of junior year. We recommend that students complete at least two of the required courses before enrollment in the minor program.\nComplete five DAN courses, including:\nat least one studio course\nat least one seminar course in dance studies, for example: DAN 215, 321 or another research-based scholarly course with approval of the director of dance.\nThe range of required courses allows for students to focus their studies on performance, choreography, dance scholarship, or to create an interdisciplinary focus. Independent work is not required to receive a minor in dance. Students interested in pursuing independent research in their senior year must meet specific course requirements, and the substitution of requirements, if necessary, will be made with the approval of the director of dance.","course_list":["DAN ***"]},{"name":"Dance Program Production Support","max_counted":1,"explanation":"All students planning to earn the minor in dance must complete the show support requirement (formerly referred to as “tech hours”) by supporting one dance program show in a nonperforming capacity. Students who will propose an independent choreographic or performance project during their senior year must have completed the show support requirement by the end of their junior year. Through supporting dance program shows, students will get to know the dance program's students and staff, our venues and our practices, and will be better prepared for independent projects.","iw_relationship":"separate","no_req":null}]}
