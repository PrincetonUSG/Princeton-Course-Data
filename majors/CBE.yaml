description: |-
  The next generation of technological solutions will come from making unforeseen connections between ideas. With that in mind, the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering curriculum builds in the flexibility for students to pursue their passions. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for a future beyond Princeton. The mission of CBE is mainly (a) to offer educational and research programs of the highest quality that will prepare students for leadership positions in the chemical, biochemical and materials industries; academia; and government laboratories; (b) to help define the frontiers of knowledge in modern chemical and biological engineering through intellectual leadership in research and scholarship; (c) to contribute to the nation's technological leadership by accomplishing research that stimulates the development of new technologies.
