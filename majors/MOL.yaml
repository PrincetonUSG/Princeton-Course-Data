description: |-
  The undergraduate program in molecular biology is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to explore the central questions of 21st century biology. The curriculum provides broad foundational knowledge in core disciplines including molecular, cellular and developmental biology, biochemistry and genetics. Students acquire depth by pursuing sub-disciplines of interest in greater detail and sophistication in upper-level elective courses, which emphasize current topics and readings from the primary literature. Because the best way to learn science is by doing science, students conduct original research at the frontiers of modern science for their independent work. In addition to becoming a scholar in their chosen field, students will become adept at formulating testable hypotheses, planning and executing well-controlled experiments, analyzing and interpreting data and formally presenting their findings both orally and in writing.

    To enter the Department of Molecular Biology, students must have completed MOL 214 with a grade of C or better. CHM 201/207 and 202 or equivalent are also required to enter the department. (For the Class of 2027 and beyond, the equivalent is AP + CHM202/215 or requirement fulfillment through the chemistry placement test.) 
    An alternate path into the department is through the integrated science curriculum.

    CHM 301 and 304, or CHM 337. Courses taken at other institutions can be used toward fulfillment of the chemistry requirements with prior approval from the Department of Chemistry. The organic chemistry requirement must be completed before the beginning of junior year.

    Students satisfy the quantitative requirement by taking one course in statistics (SML 201, ORF 245, or MOL 290) and one course in either computer science (COS 126 or above) or math (MAT 103, 104, 175, 192, or any 200-level MAT course). SML 201 and COS 126 are the recommended choices for most students. AP credit cannot be used toward the fulfillment of the quantitative requirement. Courses taken at other institutions can be substituted for the second required course (but not for the statistics course), if approved by the corresponding department.

    Physics 108 (strongly recommended), or PHY 103 and 104, or PHY 101 and 102. PHY 108 is a one-semester, biologically oriented alternative to the traditional full-year sequences. Premedical students who need two semesters of physics can combine PHY 101 or 103 with PHY 108. Neither AP credit nor courses taken at other institutions can be used toward the fulfillment of the physics requirement.

    The following core courses are required: MOL 342, MOL 345, MOL 348 and MOL 320/350. Except under very special circumstances, these courses must be taken before senior year. MOL 350 is offered in the fall to junior majors and is the conventional path for the major. MOL 320 has limited enrollment and is offered in the spring to sophomores who intend to major in MOL and plan to study abroad, or have taken/are concurrently taking MOL 348 and want an early introduction to research methods and laboratory experience. MOL 320 and MOL 350 are considered equivalent courses and only one can be taken.
    All four departmental core courses count toward the eight required departmentals. No substitutions are allowed except in the case of study abroad which, if it entails intensive research and with advanced permission, can substitute for MOL 350.

    All students must take a total of at least eight departmentals. In addition to the four departmental core courses, students must take at least one 300-, 400-, or 500-level course with MOL as the primary listing. The remaining three departmentals can be chosen from among all 300-or-higher-level MOL, MOL-cross-listed, or other approved courses (see list on department website). Note that CHM 301, CHM 304 and CHM 337 qualify as departmentals. Only courses taken at Princeton count as departmentals; there are no exceptions to this rule.

- name: Junior Independent Work

  explanation: |-
    In the fall semester of junior year, students participate in small group tutorials led by postdocs in which they read papers from the original literature and prepare two critical analysis papers on assigned topics. In the spring semester, students carry out independent work with a faculty adviser with whom they will eventually do their senior thesis research, culminating in a junior paper in the form of a grant proposal.

  explanation: |-
    During senior year each student, with the guidance of a faculty adviser, undertakes a major research effort. This research project can be a laboratory- or non-laboratory-based study that will be written and presented as a senior thesis.

- name: Senior Departmental Examination
  min_needed: 1
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |-
    Students are required to present their work to two faculty thesis readers during an oral exam at which the adviser is not present. The exam usually takes about 30 minutes and students should be prepared to describe the background of the thesis, defend its contents and propose future directions.
