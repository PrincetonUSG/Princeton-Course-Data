description: |-
  With computation and computer science now permeating all corners of society and the economy, a computer science education has become a good launching pad for almost any career. Core concepts and skills emphasized in the computer science curriculum include theoretical and quantitative analysis of computation; design/engineering principles of advanced computer systems; and foundations and methods of AI and machine learning. The curriculum provides additional flexibility to explore subdisciplines of computer science (programming languages, formal methods, software engineering, computer graphics, information security), or to branch out into exciting cross-disciplinary investigations (neuroscience and cognitive science, computational biology, information policy, robotics, data science, etc.). Most computer science majors enjoy programming. Quite a few start with zero or minimal background and can enhance their skills while progressing through the curriculum.

    All B.S.E. students must meet the School of Engineering and Applied Science general requirements. Students must complete COS 126 (or ISC 231-234 or ECE 115), 217 and 226. Students should plan to take COS 126 in the first year. COS 217 and COS 226 should be completed before junior year. One or both of these are prerequisites for all later computer science courses.

    B.S.E. students must elect one semester of independent work by enrolling in 397 (junior fall), 398 (junior spring), 497 (senior fall), or 498 (senior spring). One additional semester of independent work may be counted as one of the departmental courses. B.S.E. students are also welcome, but not required, to complete a senior thesis.
