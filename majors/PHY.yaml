  The physics department offers a comprehensive program with the flexibility to accommodate students with a range of interests. Those students wishing to maximize their preparation for graduate school can choose from a variety of advanced-level courses. The requirements of the core curriculum, however, are such that students with diverse interests can take a considerable course load outside the department. Thus, in addition to those students planning to enter graduate school in physics, the department encourages majors with career goals in such areas as engineering physics, law, medicine, materials science and teaching.

  explanation: |-
    Prerequisites for a major in physics are the following five courses: PHY 103-104, PHY 207, and MAT 203-204. These five courses should be completed by the end of sophomore year. PHY 103 may be replaced by ISC 231-232 (the first term of Integrated Science Sequence) or PHY 105. PHY 104 may be replaced by ISC 233-234 or PHY 106. The PHY 109/110 (spring/summer) sequence is fully equivalent to PHY 104. Students with a particular interest in formal mathematics may instead satisfy the MAT 203-204 prerequisite with either the MAT 215-217 or the MAT 216-218 sequence. Prerequisites for majoring in physics cannot be taken on a pass/D/fail basis.

    The elective course can be any physics department course (including cross-lists) at 300-level or above. 400-level physics courses are particularly recommended. Courses in astrophysics, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geophysical science, materials science, plasma physics and mathematics may also be appropriate, depending on the interests of the student. Courses from these departments may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the director of undergraduate studies. Graduate courses may also be taken with permission from both the instructor and the director of undergraduate studies.

- name: Junior Papers
  min_needed: 1
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |-
    In addition to the coursework carried out during junior year, the student is required to complete two junior papers, each of which is on a research topic of current interest. The purpose of the papers is to give students exposure to how physics research is actually performed by immersing them in journal, as opposed to textbook, literature. Each paper is written in close consultation with a faculty adviser, who is typically performing research in the subject area of the paper. A junior paper may serve as a preliminary investigation of a senior thesis topic. Junior independent work may also be satisfied with a short experimental project.

- name: Senior Thesis
  min_needed: 1
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |- 
    In senior year, in addition to coursework, students write a senior thesis based on their own research. The topic might be chosen from one of the active experimental or theoretical research fields of the physics department, or might be suggested by a faculty member with some subsidiary interest. A student could also choose a topic relating to physics and another field, such as geophysics, the teaching of physics, history of science or engineering physics. Students whose main adviser is outside the physics department must also have a co-adviser who is a faculty member in the physics department.

  explanation: |-
    An oral examination conducted by a departmental committee at the end of senior year serves as the senior departmental examination.
