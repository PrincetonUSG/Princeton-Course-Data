description: |-
  Operations research and financial engineering may be considered as the modern form of a liberal education: modern because it is based on science, mathematics, computing and technology, and liberal in the sense that it provides for broad intellectual development and can lead to many different types of careers. By choosing judiciously from courses in engineering, science, mathematics, economics, public policy and liberal arts, each student may design a program adapted to their particular interests.

  explanation: |-
    The departmental electives represent courses that further develop a student's skills in mathematical modeling either by a more in-depth investigation of core disciplines, applying these skills in specific areas of application, or by learning about closely related technologies. Students must choose ten courses, as appropriate, with the following constraints:
    There must be at least four courses from the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORF).
    There can be no more than three courses from any one department (excluding ORF).
