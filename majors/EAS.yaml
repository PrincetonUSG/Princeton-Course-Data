description: |-
  In the contemporary global configuration, East Asia is a center of culture, economics, science and technology. The Department of East Asian Studies (EAS) offers a wide range of undergraduate classes at the highest standards of academic, linguistic and cultural competence focused on China, Korea and Japan. While the EAS major allows in-depth study and first-hand experience of East Asia, the minor programs in Chinese, Japanese or Korean language encourage students to combine their interests in East Asian languages and civilizations with other majors they pursue at Princeton.

- name: Junior Independent Work
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    In the fall term the student participates in the departmental junior seminar (EAS 300) and also writes a junior independent work. In the spring, the student writes a second junior independent work under the supervision of an appropriate faculty member. At the end of junior year, the student begins to draft a proposal for the senior thesis.
  no_req:
- name: Senior Thesis
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    Each student prepares a senior thesis in consultation with an appropriate member of the faculty. The senior thesis represents the culmination of the undergraduate curriculum. It should be an original contribution to scholarship on East Asia, based at least in part on source materials in the student's language of specialization.
    Scholarship aid is available for senior thesis research abroad. Students should review funding opportunities listed in the Student Activities Funding Engine (SAFE), and may also want to consult the websites of the Program in East Asian Studies (EAP) and the Office of the Dean of the College (ODOC) for further information.

- name: Senior Departmental Examination
  min_needed: 1
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |-
    At the end of the spring term, the student appears before a faculty committee for an oral defense of the thesis. The defense will take the form of a conversation between the student and a faculty committee, and it will center on the senior independent work, as well as larger questions in the field of East Asian studies that inform it. Students will be asked to reflect on the process of their research: the original source of interest in their research topic; the process of fleshing out the architecture of their project; and difficulties and creative discoveries of their research and writing. The conversation will begin in the students' primary research language: Korean, Japanese or Chinese.
