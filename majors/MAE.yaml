description: |-
  The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering  recognizes that students have a variety of career objectives. Some enter industry directly in an engineering capacity and some continue their studies in graduate school in engineering or applied science. Other MAE graduates pursue careers in business, law or medicine. The department offers sufficient flexibility to students planning an undergraduate program that meets any of these objectives and guides them to build fundamental knowledge in key engineering disciplines and develop practical skills in problem-solving and design. The subjects of solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, dynamics, control systems, materials and applied mathematics, combined with the experience of engineering design, are the core of the department's curriculum. Both the mechanical and aerospace engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.
