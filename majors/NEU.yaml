  The neuroscience major provides foundational and advanced undergraduate courses on the scientific study of the brain and biology of behavior as well as practical training in theoretical, computational and/or laboratory approaches to original neuroscience research. Students learn about different levels of analysis, from the molecular mechanisms of intercellular signaling to the formation and function of neural circuits to the generation of thought and movements via large-scale neural systems. Students also learn about cutting-edge methods in neuroscience, including laboratory techniques, computational modeling and statistics. Through their independent work, students work with faculty advisers and their teams to gain understanding of how to approach current neuroscientific problems. This work can include the generation of new data via experiments, the novel analysis of existing data sets or the formulation of new perspectives and hypotheses via the thoughtful consideration of the existing literature.
