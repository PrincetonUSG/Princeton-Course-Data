description: |-
  The psychology major, within the Division of Natural Sciences, provides foundational and advanced undergraduate courses on a range of topics relating to the scientific study of mind and behavior. These include but are not limited to sensation, perception, movement, language, reasoning, decision-making, social interaction and computational models of the brain. Because psychological science involves working with large and complex data sets, students gain skills and knowledge in statistical methods. Additionally, since mental processes and behavior arise from the brain, students also acquire knowledge in neuroscience.
