description: |-
  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers an academic program of study spanning a wide range of disciplines, connecting the broad fields of information, data, communication and computing systems to circuits, energy and the physical world. To prepare students for a future beyond Princeton, the three main themes of the program are (i) a broad foundation, (ii) depth and expertise in a major, and (iii) independent work and design.

    Electrical and Computer Engineering 201, 203, and at least one of 206 or 308. This requirement is normally satisfied by the end of  sophomore year, although 206 and 308 can be delayed if foundational courses in related disciplines make this difficult. These courses are all open to all qualified first-year students.

    An engineering course with a significant scientific component must be taken outside of ECE to satisfy this requirement. Many courses can be used to satisfy this requirement; note, however, that a course comprised largely of mathematics or applied mathematics does not satisfy the requirement. The course used to satisfy the engineering science requirement cannot also be used to satisfy the major requirement or the breadth requirement, nor can it be counted as a departmental requirement. The following is a non-exhaustive list of possibilities: COS 217, 226, 320, 402, 423, 425, 451, 487; MAE 206, 221, 222, 324, 328, 344, 345, 433, 434; CEE 205, 207, 305, 471; MSE 301, 302; CBE 245, 246, 341, 415, 447; ORF 307, 311, 405, 406, 417.

    ECE students must take at least two upper-level (300- or 400-level) technical courses in each of the last four terms, called "departmental" courses. Of the eight departmental courses, at least five must be ECE courses and normally include 302 and the senior thesis (497, 498). The remaining three courses can be taken in CEE, CHM, CBE, COS, EEB, ECE, ENE, MAE, MAT, MOL, MSE, NEU, ORF, or PHY. Courses in or cross-listed with electrical and computer engineering counted toward this requirement must be closely related to the student's academic program.
    Note: Junior independent work (397, 398) and the senior thesis (497, 498) cannot be used to fulfill the breadth or major requirements.

    Each student must develop depth in a coherent area of concentration in the department by completing three
    courses in one concentration area. The ten possible concentrations span the core disciplines within ECE as
    well as important applications areas. While many concentrations are interdisciplinary, two of the three
    courses must be listed in ECE (crosslisted is OK). ORF 309/MAT 309 may be used to satisfy either the
    upperclass mathematics requirement or the concentration requirement, but not both.
    Graduate courses (500 level) are open to undergraduates after the completion of a permission form
    containing the signatures of instructor and departmental representative. The permission form is available
    from the undergraduate coordinator or you can download at http://registrar.princeton.edu/student-services/.
    Graduate courses can be included in a concentration with departmental representative permission.
