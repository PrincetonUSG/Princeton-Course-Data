  In the Department of English, students read widely across the genres and periods of British, American and Anglophone literature and explore approaches to literary study with a distinguished, internationally renowned faculty.

    Departmental distribution requirements ensure breadth in each major's program of study. Everyone must take at least one course in each of the following areas:
    Literary and Cultural History (LCH)
    Literature and Culture before 1700 (pre-1700)
    Literature and Culture from 1700-1900 (1700-1900)
    Literature and Culture from 1900-present (post-1900)
    Difference and Diversity (D&D)
    Theory and Criticism (T&C)
    Each semester, the department offers a wide variety of courses in each distribution area, and a full list is available on the department website. A single course cannot be used to satisfy two distribution requirements simultaneously. In total: There are six required distributions, plus the junior seminar (ENG 300), plus three additional English courses, for the 10 required courses for the major.
