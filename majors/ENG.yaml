description: |-
  In the Department of English, students read widely across the genres and periods of British, American and Anglophone literature and explore approaches to literary study with a distinguished, internationally renowned faculty. The department's ranks include historicists and formalists, theorists and poets, and postcolonialists and feminists; the faculty teach not only poetry, prose and drama, but film, music, art, architecture and technology. The department is united by a passion for works of the imagination and for thinking about what they mean and the difference they make in the world.
