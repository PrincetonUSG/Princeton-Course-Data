description: |-
  Anthropology is the study of human experience and social change. Through situated and relational methods, anthropology considers the ways people think, act and make sense of their lifeworlds against the backdrop of multiple structural forces and across intersecting domains and scales. Always in a deep interdisciplinary dialogue, the connections between ethnography, theory, social engagement and storytelling are a hallmark of anthropology.

    Anthropology majors must take nine departmental courses, including the core courses ANT 300 (Ethnography, Evidence and Experience) and ANT 301 (The Ethnographer's Craft). All majors are expected to participate in a senior thesis workshop during late fall semester of their senior year. The workshop is designed to help students gain traction in data analysis and writing.

    explanation: |-
      The Sociocultural Anthropology Track (SCA) is for students who want to explore contemporary forms and trajectories of human life and who seek to understand how differently positioned people address pressing social, political, environmental, technological and ethical challenges. SCA students are immersed in the histories of the discipline and are introduced to core anthropological concepts and subfields. All are encouraged to ethnographically pursue larger questions domestically and internationally and innovate in critical theory and storytelling.

      The Medical Anthropology Track (MedAnth) is for students interested in all aspects of medicine, from biosocial to therapeutic systems to cultural ideas about illness and practices of health and well-being. Choosing this track allows students who are interested in the sciences, policy, the humanities, and the subfield of medical anthropology to focus their undergraduate training around these topics.
      The MedAnth track requires nine courses total; four are required and the other five are electives selected from category groups explained below. Students in this track are allowed to substitute up to two of the five elective courses with a class taught within the Department of Anthropology but outside MedAnth. Students are also allowed to satisfy departmental courses using two cognates.

    explanation: |-
      The Law, Politics, and Economics Track (LPE) is for students interested in these three well-established fields within the discipline of anthropology. LPE students are introduced to key theories of value, exchange and justice, for example, and to the comparative studies of law, politics, development, globalization and microeconomics across societies.
      The LPE track requires nine courses total; three are required and the other six include departmental electives focused on the law, economics and politics (see examples from list below). Students in this track are allowed to substitute up to two of the six elective courses with a class taught within the Department of Anthropology but outside the LPE track. Students are also allowed to take two cognates.

        A few examples of LPE electives are shown below. These courses are typically taught every other year, although some may be offered annually and others less frequently. A list of pre-approved LPE courses will be published each semester before course enrollment begins.
        Courses pertaining to economics: Debt (ANT 225); Economic Experience in Cultural Context (ANT 303); Food, Culture, and Society (ANT 311); The Anthropology of Development (ANT 314); Economic Anthropology and American Pop Culture (ANT 350)
        Courses pertaining to politics: Violence (ANT 264); Political Anthropology (ANT 304); Revolt (319); Catastrophes across Cultures: The Anthropology of Disaster (ANT 219); Urban Anthropology (ANT 227); #BlackLivesMatter (ANT 244); Conspiracy Theory and Social Theory (ANT 406); Communist Modernity: The Politics and Culture of Soviet Utopia (SLA 420/ANT 420)
        Courses pertaining to law: The Anthropology of Law (ANT 342); Policing and Militarization Today (ANT 223); Justice (ANT 263)
        LPE students are allowed to take two cognates (as defined under Program of Study above). Appropriate cognates for LPE might include courses taught in the departments of Economics or Politics; a regional studies course; courses taken during study abroad; and/or anthropology courses taught outside the Law, Politics, and Economics track.

- name: Junior Independent Work
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    Independent work in the junior year involves an original paper focused on an anthropological theme or debate of interest to the student. The paper is mostly based on library research and literature review and should reflect the student's growing mastery of anthropological ways of knowing and the uniqueness of ethnographic evidence-making and theorizing.  New field research is not appropriate for this exercise. In the fall, students develop a detailed problem statement and annotated bibliography on a relevant subject and present a research proposal for approval by the department. In the spring, students write a paper (about 8,000 words, excluding references) based on the research initiated in the fall, in consultation with their adviser. Advising begins in assigned groups during early fall before transitioning to individual advising with continuing group work. Opportunities for peer group support and writing workshops are offered throughout junior year independent work.
    Since the junior paper topic is chosen before the final track declaration deadline, junior papers, unlike senior theses, do not have to be related to a student's chosen track.

- name: Senior Thesis
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    Independent work in the senior year consists of a thesis based on ethnographic research on a timely issue or deep analysis of the extant anthropological literature on a topic of interest. A thesis that has a central artistic component must be accompanied by a substantial written essay. Doing ethnographic or community-engaged thesis research during the summer between junior and senior years is very helpful, but not required. Students carrying out fieldwork must have IRB approval. The anthropology department encourages methodologically and theoretically innovative senior thesis projects that expand our understanding of diverse lifeworlds and reorient our ethical and political imagination.
    Anthropology seniors are each assigned a thesis adviser early in the fall term. A senior workshop that meets periodically during the second half of the fall term is designed to help students develop their senior theses; all seniors are expected to participate.
    Students are encouraged to utilize the VizE Lab for Ethnographic Data Visualization to receive assistance in creating multimodal senior theses that combine field-based ethnographic storytelling, visual documentary and online interactive data visualizations.
    Anthropology theses are usually multipart or multichapter projects, ranging from 20,000 to 25,000 words.
