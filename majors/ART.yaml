  The Department of Art and Archaeology is devoted to the study of the visual arts and the investigation of material artifacts from a wide range of cultures and periods. Students may pursue a major in the History of Art or the Practice of Art; information on the certificate in Archaeology is also included below. Studio art courses are taught by faculty in the Program in Visual Arts; history of art courses also frequently include practical components. Students interested in the practice of art (taught by faculty in the Program in Visual Arts) can pursue a major in the department. Working closely with faculty members in small classes and often dealing directly with original objects and primary sources, students can explore subjects as diverse as Roman or modern city planning, arts of printing and book-making in East Asia or Europe, ancient or medieval archaeology, architectural history, 19th-21st century photography and contemporary arts of Africa, Latin America and the United States.
  Majors in this track explore the traditions, thought processes and methods of making visual art in connection with a liberal arts education. Studio courses are offered in painting, drawing, printmaking, graphic design, media, sculpture, photography, film and video production. Students also study art history and theory.

      explanation: |-
        During the fall of junior year, all majors must take the junior seminar, VIS 392 Issues in Contemporary Art. Beginning with the Class of 2023, film students will also be required to take VIS 392. VIS 392 coincides with admission to the junior studios and investigates the history, challenges and rewards of studio practice. Through readings, discussions, studio critiques and a culminating exhibition of works in progress, VIS 392 provides the foundation for students' independent creative development, as well as the impetus for beginning to be able to articulate the historical precedents and ambitions of their work. Students are also strongly encouraged to take ART 400, the junior methods seminar in the Department of Art and Archaeology.

        The Department of Art and Archaeology courses must include one course from Group 1 (ancient) or Group 2 (medieval/early modern) and one course from Group 3 (19th century to the present). The remaining two courses may come from any group. When multiple courses are selected from the same group, breadth in chronological and geographic focus among them is encouraged.

The Department of Art and Archaeology courses must include: one course from Group 1 (ancient) or Group 2 (medieval/early modern); one course from Group 3 (19th century to the present); and two from any group.

  explanation: |-
    Junior independent work begins in the fall, in the context of the junior seminar. It continues into the spring in partnership with two faculty advisers, one from VIS and one from ART. Students are provided with studio space and prepare independent work over the course of the year, culminating in an exhibition as part of the Spring Junior Group Thesis Show. Film students work throughout their junior year to create a junior film.
    All Practice of Art juniors assemble a writing portfolio consisting of multiple short essays amounting to approximately 10 pages (2,500 words). The essays reflect on the creating process and discuss the relation of the work to the student's broader studies, especially in art history. The essays should include a bibliography. The grade for independent work is the average of the grade from the VIS and ART advisers. For further description of the portfolios, see the Undergraduate Handbook.
    The Junior Independent Work requirement in Practice of Art includes two colloquia with the History of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.

  explanation: |-
    By the end of the second week of the fall term of senior year, students must have three advisers, including one from the Department of Art and Archaeology faculty, who is selected in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. The senior independent work is a major studio project completed by the end of the spring term, done in consultation with the student's advisers, and a writing portfolio consisting of multiple short essays amounting to approximately 20 pages (5,000 words). The essays reflect on the creating process and discuss the relation of the work to the student's broader studies, especially in art history. The essays should include a bibliography. For further description of the portfolios, see the Undergraduate Handbook. Students are assigned semiprivate studios on the second floor of 185 Nassau. Students present their work in an exhibition at the end of the year at the Lewis Center. An “Advisers' Thesis Critique” is performed by the ART and VIS advisers in the presence of the exhibit. The grade for the senior independent work is the average of the grade given by the ART and VIS advisers during the thesis critique and for the written component. 
    The senior independent work requirement in Practice of Art includes two colloquia with the History of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.

- name: Senior Departmental Examination
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    The senior departmental examination in the Practice of Arts has two parts. (1) A one-hour critical discussion (the “Crit”) of the senior thesis exhibition in the latter half of the spring term, in the presence of each student's exhibition. The discussion is open to all Program in Visual Arts faculty and Practice of Art/certificate students. All Visual Arts faculty who attend the Crit will grade it, and those grades will be averaged. (2) Practice of Art students participate in the same comprehensive exam ("Comps") as the History of Art students (see above). The VIS primary adviser and the ART adviser will be two of the three faculty present at the comprehensive exam; the three grades will be averaged for the Comps grade. The final grade on the transcript for the departmental examination is the average of the Crit grade and the Comps grade.
