description: |-
  The history major provides foundational and advanced undergraduate courses on the study of the past. History courses range over the past two thousand years of human experience in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Students can learn about these areas of the globe and periods of the past from a variety of different perspectives including cultural, economic, environmental, ethnic, gender, intellectual, political and social history. Students have the opportunity to pursue independent work in two junior papers and a senior thesis. Within the context of a research seminar in the first semester of their junior year, students learn the basic tools of historical research such as finding a research subject, formulating a historical question and canvasing an archive. In the second semester of their junior year, students pursue a junior paper in consultation with a faculty member and independent of the seminar. In their senior year, students deploy these skills in research and writing a 75-page senior thesis based on original historical research. History majors graduate from Princeton with a sense of the depth and the breadth of the historical study of the human past and with the capacity to express themselves on a range of issues in clear and analytic prose.

  explanation: |-
    Departmental regulations stipulate that undergraduates must pass at least 10 courses, including HIS 400, in order to receive the A.B. 
    degree.
    The department allows students to take courses in other departments that will add depth and variety to their study of history.  When taken during the junior and senior years, up to two (2) such courses may be counted as departmental courses, i.e., cognates, provided they contribute significantly to the student's major and/or independent work, and are substantially historical in their content. Cross-listed courses, such as CLA 217 and NES 201, are not cognates; they are automatically considered departmental courses. The designation of a course as a cognate must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. The designation of a cognate course as a departmental should take place during the enrollment/advising period but no later than the University's "deadline for 'free course' change" (approximately two weeks after the beginning of the semester). Courses cannot be declared cognates retroactively, nor can they be changed later to non-departmentals. Cognate courses do not satisfy distribution requirements; however, they count in the determination of departmental standing and honors.

  min_needed: 1
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |-
    Juniors write two junior papers of roughly 25-30 pages in length, one in each semester.
    In the fall term of junior year, students are required to enroll in the HIS 400 Junior Seminars. Work in the junior seminar involves exercises in defining a topic for historical research and in identifying and evaluating a body of historical literature. Each student may expect to gain experience in the use of the library and bibliographical sources, to learn the correct technical form for presenting evidence clearly, and to develop a historical presentation convincingly. Students in HIS 400 will have the opportunity to choose from a number of seminars devoted to historical events or themes of wide importance, such as Irregular Warfare, Space History, Early Native American History, The United States and Latin America, or The Political Uses of American Streets.
    In the spring term of junior year, in consultation with their adviser, the student selects a topic and writes a research paper on an independent basis. Written work equivalent to that submitted in the first term is required. The two semesters of junior independent work must be focused in two different geographical fields and in two different time periods. Students should consult their advisers about this requirement.
  no_req:
- name: Senior Thesis

    The independent work consists of writing a thesis on an approved subject of the student's choice. The thesis usually relies on research in original source materials, but it may also involve reinterpretation of familiar materials.
