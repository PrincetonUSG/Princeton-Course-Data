description: |-
  Requirements for study in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering follow the general requirements for the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the University. The student's course of study is planned in consultation with the director of studies and the academic adviser and requires a year-long thesis, which counts as two courses. The CEE curriculum is sufficiently flexible to provide opportunities for students to pursue certificate programs across the University, and to study abroad in their junior year.
