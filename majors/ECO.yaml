description: |-
  Economic analysis plays a central role in many disciplines within the social sciences. It has three main branches: macroeconomics provides the language and tools for analyzing economic policy and aggregate economic outcomes; microeconomics offers a framework for understanding interactions among individuals or organizations and the role that incentives and information play in these interactions; and econometrics confronts macroeconomic and microeconomic theories with data. The economics department trains students in each of these three branches of economics and enables them to apply this understanding to problems within one or more subfields of economics (such as monetary economics, international finance, development economics, industrial organization, public finance, health economics, environmental economics, political economy, labor economics and international trade).

  min_needed: ALL
  max_counted: 1
  explanation: |-
    To enter the department, a student must complete the prerequisite courses ECO 100, ECO 101, ECO 202 (or equivalent), and MAT 175 (or equivalent) by the end of sophomore year and earn a letter grade of C or better in each course. MAT 201 or EGR 156 can be substituted for MAT 175.
    To satisfy the statistics prerequisite, ECO 202 can be substituted with (a) ORF 245 or (b) POL 345 in combination with POL 346. POL 345 alone will not count as a substitute for ECO 202. PSY 251, SPI 200 and SOC 301 will not be accepted.

  explanation: |-
    All majors must pass, on a graded basis, core courses in microeconomics (ECO 300 or 310), macroeconomics (ECO 301 or ECO 311) and econometrics (ECO 302 or ECO 312). These courses must be completed during or before junior year. Each of the three core courses is offered in two versions to accommodate different levels of preparation in mathematics: ECO 300, ECO 301 and ECO 302 require MAT 175; ECO 310 and 311 require MAT 201, and ECO 312 requires MAT 201 + MAT 202.

  explanation: |-
    In addition to the three core courses, majors must pass, on a graded basis, five other departmental courses. Departmentals can be any 300-, 400-, or 500-level economics courses, or an approved cognate.
    Economics majors are allowed to count a maximum of two courses from other departments as cognates. These courses must have substantial economics content. A course with an economics cross-listing (indicated by an ECO 3XX, ECO 4XX or ECO 5XX number in its first or second listing) counts as a regular departmental, not as a cognate. Courses that will be automatically recognized by TigerHub as cognates are listed below. No application is necessary for these courses.

  explanation: |-
    Independent work is designed to afford majors the opportunity to identify and explore their research interests in depth. Students are expected to develop a carefully reasoned exposition that critically analyzes a problem using basic principles of economics. Juniors complete a year-long research project, which consists of a research prospectus submitted in December and a final paper submitted in April. The senior thesis is expected to be more extensive, with a topic of greater scope and correspondingly broader analysis and interpretation. Further details, from the assignment of advisers to the final deadlines, are available in the junior independent work and senior thesis sections of the department's website.

    The senior comprehensive examination is a written exam that covers the department's required courses (intermediate microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics). The senior comprehensive exam grade will appear on the student's transcript.
