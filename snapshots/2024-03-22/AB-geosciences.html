Courses in geosciences apply principles of biology, chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics to real Earth problems, deal with length scales from global to atomic and consider timescales from billions of years to less than a second. The flexible academic program allows students to develop individualized courses of study.</p>

<p>Undergraduates studying geosciences often pursue careers in basic research, the energy industry and education. Geosciences also provides a foundation for careers in applied research, environmental consulting, engineering, public policy, conservation, resource economics, environmental education and general consulting.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The intellectual excitement of modern geosciences is fueled by our exploration of the dynamic forces and delicate balances that mold our planet and have rendered it conducive to life for much of its history. Our landscape is continually reshaped by the movement of cold continents atop the hot, viscous mantle, and our lives are altered by the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that attend their collision. Rocks that cover Earth's surface sink to great depths and transform under enormous temperatures and pressures, perhaps to be uplifted as mountains and exposed to future generations by the forces of erosion. The ocean and atmosphere engage in a continuous and complex dialogue that controls Earth's climate. Chemical reactions operating within microorganisms and on a variety of mineral and other natural surfaces are integrated into large geochemical fluxes, which distribute the resources needed for life, and life in turn alters these fluxes. This process operates within the framework of biological evolution, in which diverse organisms appear, evolve and vanish, sometimes leaving a transfigured world in their wake. All of these processes influence our daily lives in profound and surprising ways.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Many of the great challenges to humanity, today and in the future, involve processes that are studied by Earth scientists, leading to a rapidly increasing role for the field in issues of environmental regulation and public policy. A background in the Earth sciences is an essential component of contemporary education. Practicing geoscientists study nature both in the field and in the lab. To an ever-increasing degree, they must quantify observations with the aim of not only describing the past but also predicting the future of our planet, often with the aid of rigorous laboratory and field experiments, and intensive computation and modeling. The diversity of processes that characterize Earth as a whole requires geosciences to be an extraordinarily interdisciplinary field with direct connections to mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and computer science. As a result of these connections, the geosciences department frequently draws students from many backgrounds. Many of our most successful graduates begin their undergraduate careers in subjects ranging from physics to English.

  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The field of geosciences is central to many of the most pressing issues of today’s world: Earth resources and energy; natural hazards; human/environment interaction; and climate change. Through diverse coursework, small class sizes and strong field and laboratory programs, the Department of Geosciences empowers students to understand how the Earth works and how to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Coursework and research in geosciences (GEO) can center on theory, numerical modeling, lab work and/or field observations. The geosciences&nbsp;often involve studying the properties&nbsp;of&nbsp;rock, soil, water, air, fossils and/or living microbes. Such studies require&nbsp;learning&nbsp;to observe the natural world using a combination&nbsp;of&nbsp;human senses and instrumentation, and recently have taken Princeton undergraduates on field expeditions around the world. A geoscience major has the opportunity to probe the samples they collect using a variety&nbsp;of&nbsp;state-of-the-art laboratory techniques, from mass spectrometry to synchrotron beamlines, from DNA probes to chemostats, from electron microscopes to serial giga-imagers. In the classroom, junior colloquium and PI labs, students learn to apply a range&nbsp;of&nbsp;quantitative approaches including statistics, numerical modeling, machine&nbsp;learning, new computational theory and super computing. Students may apply these methods to explore potential solutions to policy problems such as climate change and water/air pollution.</p>

<p>Communication also is a central part&nbsp;of&nbsp;the geosciences curriculum. Poster sessions, oral presentations and written work in both coursework and research build on what students learn as first-year students in the writing seminars about the values held in common across disciplines — e.g., articulating a compelling question or problem, making an argument based on evidence and analysis, and engaging responsibly with sources. Students are encouraged to build on these experiences by presenting their work at Princeton Research Day (PRD) and international disciplinary conferences.</p></div>

<h4><strong>Junior Independent Work</strong></h4>

<p>All juniors are required to conduct independent research in both the fall and spring terms. Each term, this work includes a written progress report, final written report and a poster presentation of the student's final JP work.&nbsp; Faculty members will evaluate student poster presentations and submit feedback and grades. Although geoengineers are not required to conduct JP research, some geoengineers have conducted independent research in geosciences or engineering for course credit.</p>

<p>Different research topics are available in any given year and some ideas are listed in the shopping guide, which students obtain from the undergraduate coordinator. Students are encouraged to consult with their faculty advisers for suggestions regarding selection of the JP project. If students have other exciting ideas for possible JP projects, they are encouraged to consult their faculty advisers to discuss the feasibility of pursuing them.</p>

<p>The fall JP consists of a research proposal. The proposal includes a statement of the hypothesis you are proposing to test, a literature review that motivates your work, and preliminary data collection (i.e., fieldwork, laboratory analysis and/or data mining) and analysis that convinces the reader you will be able to test your central hypothesis. The fall JP is introduced as a poster presentation to the geosciences department prior to submitting a final written report.</p>

<p>The spring JP project is a full scientific research paper. A student may choose to work on the same topic they proposed in the fall or on a completely new topic with a new adviser. All spring JP work must include original data analysis; a literature review by itself does not qualify as a JP project. Many opportunities for collecting data are available, either through the student's own efforts (including fieldwork, experiments conducted in any of the several laboratories in the department, and computer simulations) or by accessing databases made available by and for the scientific community at large. The spring JP is presented as a poster to the geosciences department prior to submitting a final written report.</p>

<p>Proposals for funding to support independent work are due in late September/early October for the fall JP, and mid-February for the spring JP (but please see the ST/JP Guide for details each year as the due dates are subject to change). Part of the JP grade is awarded based on two reports submitted at two different milestones during the semester. The final grade for both fall and spring independent research is based on the quality of the research and the written and oral work of the student.</p>

<h4><strong>Senior Independent Work</strong></h4>

<p>The senior research thesis project involves a more in-depth study in the chosen topic and is a full-year effort. Students should budget their time accordingly. Each geosciences senior will choose an appropriate faculty member as their senior thesis adviser in consultation with the departmental adviser and the faculty members who support the student's interests. The student is expected to conduct research in the adviser's laboratory and work closely with the adviser and/or graduate students/postdoctoral fellows.</p>

<p>The department publishes a shopping guide, which lists some research topics that the geosciences faculty members currently are pursuing. The shopping guide is a good starting point to identify a list of topics and research advisers from which students can select a topic and adviser for their senior independent research in consultation with the departmental adviser and faculty members. Students interested in pursuing a topic that is not part of the shopping guide are encouraged to approach their departmental adviser to discuss the feasibility of conducting the research either under the supervision of a faculty member in the department or in another department in the University. Many students select their projects early, in consultation with the faculty adviser, and begin the research during the summer preceding senior year. The department and the faculty adviser usually provide the necessary funds to conduct the independent research.</p>

<p>The department requires that a student submit a thesis proposal (due in late September or early October) and several interim research progress reports, including the fall semester progress report, a rough draft of the thesis for feedback, and the final thesis. The goal of the interim reports is to facilitate timely adviser-student feedback, help minimize the unavoidable thesis rush at the end of the year, and ensure that the final product of the thesis is of the highest quality. In addition to writing their theses, all students give oral presentations to the faculty and students of the geosciences department. The grade for the thesis is based on the quality of the research, the written report and the oral presentation.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Senior Departmental Examination</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The comprehensive examination in the department consists of an oral examination based on the senior thesis and related topics.</p>

<h4>Grading and Honors</h4>

<h5><strong>Senior Thesis</strong></h5>

<p>You will be graded on (1) your thesis research plus written report and (2) oral presentation plus answers to questions.</p>

<h6><strong>Thesis Grade</strong></h6>

<ol><li>Written thesis: Quality and clarity of writing, proper organization and citations, illustration of results, interpretation, and discussion, originality, and commitment to doing the best possible lab-, field-, or model-based research. Grade determined by adviser and second reader.</li>
	<li>Oral presentation: Based on quality and clarity of presentation in lecture and illustrations as well as facility in answering questions pertaining to research results. Grade determined by the entire faculty.</li>
</ol><p>The final thesis grade will be set only after a meeting of the faculty to discuss and rank all theses. In general, an A on a senior thesis means that the work and write-up submitted have sufficient merit to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The final thesis grade is reported to the registrar and appears on the student's transcript.</p>

<h5>Academic Honors</h5>

<p>The department awards academic honors (Honors, High Honors, Highest Honors) based on a combination of factors, including the overall grade point average (GPA), departmental GPA, the relevance and degree of difficulty of course load, junior research papers and senior thesis. If the student has taken more than the required courses, then the courses with the highest grades that satisfy the major and breadth requirements are used in the calculation. For the senior thesis and junior research papers, the assigned grades will be used. In addition to grades, dedication to research, academic participation and the overall impressions the student has made on the faculty are taken into consideration in the honors calculation. To ensure that the quality of honors remains consistent from year to year, the faculty compares student achievements with those from previous years.</p></div>

<div class="field field--name-field-ua-additional-information field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Additional Information</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>Field Programs</h4>

<p>Since experience in field geology can be an important aspect of professional training, students are encouraged to take a course in field methods in geology and oceanography.</p>

<h4>Geological Field Camp</h4>

<p>After their first year, sophomore, or junior year, many of our students enroll in a geosciences summer field camp (students should consult their faculty adviser in the November before they plan to attend summer field camp). Other students choose to work with a faculty member or a graduate student in the field, and may conduct independent research for junior or senior independent research as part of this opportunity. Geosciences facilitates student enrollment in these field opportunities by providing financial aid.</p>

<h4>Experience at Sea</h4>

<p>Students interested in ocean studies can participate in ongoing studies at sea or at the Bermuda Biological Station. The department tries to make available opportunities to interested undergraduates to participate in an oceanographic cruise at some time during their undergraduate years.</p>

<p>Information on other opportunities for field experience is made available annually. The student should consult the DUS if interested in participating in field programs.</p>

<h4>Financial Assistance</h4>

<p>Grants for fieldwork in geology are available through the Tony Conway '36 Memorial Scholarship Fund. Grants for field and museum studies and research in natural history during the summer are available to students of high scholastic standing from the John Boyd '43 Memorial Fund and the Glenn L. Jepsen '27 Fund. Grants are available from the Erling Dorf '33 Fund for fieldwork and the field course. The Howard T. Vaum Jr. '78 Fund supports studies in geological engineering in a field study program. Grants for environmental studies are available from the High Meadows&nbsp;Environmental Institute. Students seeking assistance from any of these funds should present a proposal (two pages of research description) by February 15 to the DUS.</p>

<p>Funds are available from time to time for qualified undergraduates to serve as research assistants to faculty members during the regular academic session as well as during the summer months.</p>

<p>In some instances, summer employment for qualified students can be arranged with governmental, commercial or academic field parties.</p>

<h4>Certificate Programs</h4>

<p>The department offers a certificate program in geological engineering in collaboration with the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, which is described in the entry for the Program in Geological Engineering. The department also cooperates in the certificate programs in environmental studies, materials science and engineering, planets and life, and teacher preparation. Several geosciences courses fulfill the requirements of these certificate programs.</p>

<h4>Geosciences Advisers</h4>

<p>Each geosciences junior and senior is assigned an adviser, who is a faculty member and part of the Undergraduate Work Committee. Students are expected to meet regularly with their advisers for discussions on curriculum, course selection, choice of junior and senior research paper topics, study abroad plans and the like. Once the courses have been selected in consultation with the adviser, students turn in their signed fall and spring course worksheet to the undergraduate coordinator. Any course changes also should be discussed and approved by the adviser or the DUS. At the beginning of each academic year, students will be informed who their geosciences advisers are.</p></div>

                The ocean and the atmosphere control Earth's climate, and in turn climate and atmospheric changes influence the ocean. We explore the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere, their chemical compositions and their interactions that make up the climate system, including exchanges of heat and carbon. We then investigate how these circulations control marine ecosystems and the biological and chemical cycles of the Earth system. The final part of the course focuses on human impacts, including changes in coastal environments and acidification and warming that result from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. One weekly precept complements lectures.

processes to study the formation and evolution of Earth through time. We discuss how these processes
create and sustain habitable conditions on Earth's surface, including feedbacks and tipping points as
recorded in the geologic record. Topics include: stellar and planetary formation, plate tectonics, the
geologic record, natural resources, the hydrologic cycle and sedimentation, paleoclimatology, and the
"Anthropocene". Students will apply these topics to the recent geologic past to assess the impact of
humans on their environments.
