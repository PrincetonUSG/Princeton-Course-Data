The department offers two rigorous and highly flexible majors tracks, in which students chart their own paths within broad areas of study and are encouraged to develop innovative research projects, working closely with world-leading faculty, graduate students engaged in exciting scholarship and highly motivated undergraduate peers within the department. Because of the diversity of the topics studied by the faculty, ranging from Proto-Indo-European linguistics to medieval manuscripts to the cultural politics of the modern Caribbean, the department is able to support students exploring a wide range of subjects and pursuing independent work involving humanistic and social-scientific analysis, creative projects and experimental research. The unusually broad and diverse intellectual range of our program is matched by an intimate, supportive environment in which faculty and students work closely together.</p>

<p>Majors acquire, in the course of their studies, the language skills appropriate to their interests and research plans, either through departmental language courses or summer study (which the department has resources to fund). The relevant competencies will vary substantially depending on interest, and the director of undergraduate studies can advise on the appropriate course of study in order to realize a student’s intellectual and personal ambitions. The department regularly commits substantial funds to enable students to pursue their learning goals through domestic and international summer programs, including language courses, archaeological digs and independent research projects.</p></div>

It also places ancient Greece and Rome within the context of the greater Ancient Mediterranean and explores the reception of antiquity in a variety of times and places. Students learn how to evaluate complex and partial evidence and how to analyze premodern societies through texts and objects, while exploring and critiquing concepts and discourses vitally important in today’s world. The sequence of independent work gradually builds research, analysis and communication skills as the students learn to formulate and answer questions appropriate to the scope of each paper, responsive to available evidence, and promising to make an original contribution to our knowledge. &nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="field__label">Program of Study</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>Program 1. Classical Studies</h4>

<p>The classical studies program offers the opportunity for sustained and focused inquiry into the history, literature and culture of the ancient Mediterranean, as well as the impact of classical antiquity on later periods by using a variety of interpretative methods. The program offers students maximum flexibility to chart their course through departmental and related offerings. The particular program for each student is determined in collaboration with the DUS, and should be coherent and lead to viable research projects. Whatever the individual focus, each student’s program must contain eight courses at the 200 level or above (with limited exceptions as described below), including two at the 300 level, plus the junior seminar.</p>

<p>Five of the eight courses counted toward requirements must be taught by Department of Classics faculty (in general, these courses will have CLA, CLG or LAT as the first course code listing; the DUS can approve exceptions for courses taught by affiliated faculty). Three elective courses may be counted toward the major that are either cross-listed by classics or approved by the DUS as relevant to the student’s program of study. Of the eight courses, one must deal primarily with ancient literature, whether read in the original or in translation; the sequence of CLG/LAT 105-108 may be counted as a single departmental course and used to fulfill this requirement. One course must deal primarily with ancient history; this requirement may be fulfilled by taking any of CLA 216-219 (the Greek and Roman history surveys) or an approved alternative. One course must deal substantially with classical reception or comparative approaches to the ancient world; this requirement may also be fulfilled by study of another language relevant to the student’s interests (Akkadian, Modern Greek, etc., at any course level). Students are otherwise free, in consultation with the DUS, to chart their own path through the department’s offerings.</p>

<h4>Program 2. Ancient History</h4>

<p>The program offers students a pathway to explore the history of ancient Greece and Rome and their relationships with the neighboring cultures of the Near East, Europe and Africa. It is also ideal for students interested in acquiring training in the academic discipline of history while concentrating on the period spanning the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1700 B.C.E.) to the early medieval and Byzantine worlds (ca. 600 C.E.). Although students may specialize in a particular field of history (political, social, economic, cultural), geographic area or historical period of antiquity, the aim of the program is to provide well-rounded training in the field of history, with a focus on ancient history. Each student’s program must contain eight courses at the 200 level or above (with limited exceptions as described below), including two at the 300 level, plus the junior seminar.</p>

<p>The eight courses taken toward the ancient history track must include one survey course on ancient Greek history (CLA 216 or 217) and one survey course on Roman history (CLA 218 or 219); one course substantially dealing with ancient material culture; and one course on premodern (i.e., pre-1789) history or non-industrial societies beyond Greece and Rome. An additional course that introduces students to the main methods, theories and/or philosophies of history is also strongly encouraged. The remaining elective courses should follow a coherent plan that prepares the student for independent research; ordinarily, any course listed as CLA, CLG or LAT at the 200 level or above will count, and other courses may be approved by the DUS for&nbsp;credit toward the major. One of the courses may be fulfilled by the sequence of CLG/LAT 105–108 or study of another language relevant to the student’s interests at any level.&nbsp;</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p><em>Junior Seminar</em>. During the fall of junior year, all majors take the junior seminar (CLA 340). The course introduces students to different fields of study within the department, including literature, ancient history, ancient culture, linguistics and reception studies. Students will gain experience in the methods of their chosen area(s) of study while acquiring an understanding of the history of the discipline and its place in the 21st century. Students will also acquire the skills necessary to pursue independent work. Students who are abroad during the fall of their junior year may complete the junior seminar during the fall semester of their senior year.</p>

<p><em>Junior Independent Work.</em> In the fall term, each student researches and writes a paper of 12–15 pages on a topic of their choosing under the direction of a faculty adviser. The junior seminar will provide guidance in choosing and researching a topic. In the spring term, students undertake a more ambitious research paper of 20–25 pages. Each student again works closely with a member of the faculty on the project, meeting regularly over the course of the term.</p>

<p><em>Senior Independent Work</em>. At the end of junior year, majors propose a provisional thesis topic to the DUS along with a list of potential faculty advisers, on the basis of which they are assigned a thesis adviser. The thesis in its final form shall be submitted to the DUS by April 15 (or, when this falls on a weekend, on the following Monday) of senior year.</p></div>

      <div class="field__item"><p>Students in the Classes of 2024, 2025 and 2026 who are pursuing a major other than classics may still demonstrate command of one of the classical languages and cultures by working toward a certificate in Greek or Roman language and culture.</p>

<p>The requirements are:</p>

<ol><li>Three CLG or three LAT courses, one of which may be at the 200 level while the others must be at the 300 level.</li>
	<li>A piece of independent work. This can be satisfied in several ways: (a) by a substantial paper developed from one of the courses taken to fulfill the certificate requirement (this will be in addition to the work required in the course); (b) by a substantial independent paper advised by a member of the classics faculty; or (c) with the agreement of the home department and classics DUS, by a piece of independent work that satisfies the requirements of both classics and the home department. As a substitute for this requirement, students may take either an additional course in their language (CLG or LAT) at the 200- or 300 level, or a CLA course focusing on the culture of their certificate program (Greek or Roman).</li>

      <div class="field__item"><p>The classics major prepares students for any career path they wish to pursue, and is well suited to fulfilling requirements for medical and law school admissions, as well as pursuing teacher training through the Program in Teacher Preparation. In addition to medicine, law and education, classics majors have gone on to pursue distinguished careers in the arts, public service, business, finance, politics, academia, journalism and many other fields. Students intending to continue on to graduate work in classics will in most cases need to acquire advanced competence in both Latin and Greek in order to be competitive for admission to Ph.D. programs (though there are now many good options for deepening knowledge after graduation in the form of post-baccalaureate programs). The department is committed to helping students chart a path after graduation by involving its extensive alumni network, and through tailored advising.</p></div>

                Stylish, seductive, surreptitious, and scorned, the ubiquitous art of persuasion will be the focus of this course. We will first approach rhetoric through the classical tradition, learning to recognize basic figures of speech and thought with an eye towards identifying what is persuasive and why. We will then consider how rhetoric continues to thrive, despite abundant moral and philosophical attacks, in public self-presentation, whether of household products, of politicians, or institutions such as Princeton.

It is also to see the kinds of questions and problems that arise when healers take responsibility for the care and treatment of bodies.

                The subject of this course will be medieval Greek Romantic fiction. We will read translations of the four surviving novels written in twelfth-century Constantinople in a bid to answer questions about the link between eroticism and the novel, truth and invention in the middle ages, who read fiction and why, and what role, if any, did the medieval or Byzantine Romances have in the story of the European novel. Above all, we will seek to recover some of the pleasure felt by the medieval readers and audiences of these novels.

                The ancients were fascinated by dreams and debated a variety of views about the nature, origin, and function of dreams. Are dreams divine messages about the future, our souls' indications of impending diseases, or just distorted versions of earlier thoughts? Do dreams have meaning and if so, how can we understand them? We will explore ancient approaches to dreams and their enigmas in literature and philosophy, medical texts, and religious practices. Although our focus will be on Greek and Roman texts, we will also pay attention to earlier Near Eastern sources as well as modern dream theories from Freud to scientific dream research.
