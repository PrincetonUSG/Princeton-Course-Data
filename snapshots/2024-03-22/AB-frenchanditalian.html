Its courses provide practical instruction in the French and Italian languages; the literatures and cultures of France and Italy in all periods, from medieval to contemporary; and literature in French written in other parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.</p>

<p>Students are encouraged to complement their courses in French and/or Italian with related and varied courses in other literatures, art history, history, political science, sociology, comparative literature or other humanities subjects.</p>

<p>In addition to serving as the focus for an education in liberal arts, the French and Italian majors can be the basis for graduate or professional study. In mostly small classes and seminars, allowing extensive student/teacher interaction, students also become equipped to pursue careers&nbsp;in such areas as&nbsp;journalism, business, law, government service and international affairs. For nonmajors, the department offers a rich set of language courses, from introductory to very advanced. It also offers a popular certificate program, allowing the study of French and Italian to be combined with majors in history, architecture, English, politics or any other subject available at Princeton.</p>

<h3><strong>The French Language Program</strong></h3>

<p>All students who wish to continue a language begun in secondary school must have their proficiency assessed by a departmental placement test administered prior to course registration.&nbsp;Since 2020, all students who received a 5 on the AP exam, a 760 on the SAT subject test, or a 7 on the higher-level IB test must take the departmental placement test in order to confirm their advanced placement.&nbsp;Students will only be awarded credit for the AP exam, SAT, and higher IB if they pass the departmental placement test, which must also be confirmed through an interview with the placement officer, Dr. Murielle Perrier. Students who pass the language placement test have fulfilled the University's language requirement for general education and are eligible for a FRE 200+ class.</p>

<p>The normal program for beginners seeking a basic mastery of French is the sequence 101, 102 and 107, which satisfies the University's language requirement.</p>

<p>Students who demonstrate particular gifts in 101 may be admitted to the accelerated, double-credit spring course, 102-7, which also satisfies the University's language requirement.</p>

<p>Students with advanced placement in French will be placed in either 103 or 105 and will proceed to either 107 or 108 to satisfy the University language requirement. They also may be placed directly into 108. Students who have successfully completed 107 cannot take 108.</p>

<p>Course credit in 107 or 108 is also available through approved summer courses abroad (see Study and Work Abroad below). Funding may be available for selected and committed students. Students must pass a placement test upon their return to satisfy the language requirement.</p>

<h3><strong>The Italian Language Program</strong></h3>

<p>All students who wish to continue a language begun in secondary school must have their proficiency assessed by a departmental placement test administered prior to course registration.&nbsp;Since 2020, all students who received a 5 on the AP exam, a 760 on the SAT subject test, or a 7 on the higher-level IB test must take the departmental placement test in order to confirm their advanced placement. Students will only be awarded credit for the AP exam, SAT, and higher IB if they pass the departmental placement test, which must also be confirmed through an interview with the placement officer, Dr. Daniele De Feo. Students who pass the language placement test have fulfilled the University's language requirement for general education and are eligible for an ITA 200+ class.</p>

<p>The normal program for beginners seeking a basic mastery of Italian is the sequence 101, 102 and 107, which satisfies the University's language requirement.</p>

<p>Students who demonstrate particular gifts in 101 may be admitted to the accelerated, double-credit spring course, 102-7, which also satisfies the University's language requirement.</p>

<p>All questions concerning placement and summer study are handled by the director of the&nbsp;relevant language program.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>Majors in French or Italian master a number of vital skills in the process of studying the literature, culture, art, society and history of French and Italian speakers around the world. Beyond acquiring a solid command of the language — written and spoken — and the coveted ability to function flawlessly in the target language — in professional as well as personal contexts — students also gain deep insights into the making of a rich, unique and complex cultural tradition that continues to impact the modern world. They learn to engage directly, without passing through translation, with the works and legacies of artists, writers, thinkers and historical figures who, from the Middle Ages to the present, and from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, have left an indelible imprint on the world and continue to influence thought and creativity today.</p>

<p>The department welcomes students with a broad variety of interests and approaches. The study of literature, language and culture lies at the core of our discipline, along with the methods of analysis tailored to these objects (notably literary and critical theory). But in learning to apply this lens —&nbsp;<em>i.e., to read cultural artifacts</em> <em>critically</em> (from poems and films to institutions and practices) — students are also invited to develop their own unique area of expertise, often with substantial input from neighboring disciplines, and to explore the cultural response to a wide variety of problems and challenges. These may be artistic, but may also emerge from an engagement with broader social concerns, including gender, race, politics, environment, technology, health, urbanism, commerce, religion, education and ethics.</p>

<p>What students will take away from FIT, aside from an impressive command of French or Italian, a deep familiarity with a rich foreign culture and a new and distinct way of looking at the world — one that will inevitably enrich their outlook on everything else — is a unique capacity to read the world critically (words, objects, cultures) and to grasp how the stories, symbols, structures, images and beliefs that make up both individual identities and social formations have been continuously fabricated in the course of time. They will also, and more importantly, perhaps, develop the tools needed to imagine how many of these frameworks and narratives might be reshaped in a future that will be increasingly global, diverse and interactive, and in which the capacity for intercultural exchange will be an essential skill. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Prerequisites</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The minimum&nbsp;requirement for admission to the department is successful completion of the language sequence (FRE 107 or 108;&nbsp;ITA 107 or 108), or equivalent qualification. Students are encouraged to complete at least one advanced-language course (FRE 207, 207F, or 208; ITA 207I, 208) prior to admission, or shortly thereafter, and may also count one such course toward the major. It is further recommended that students complete at least one more 200-level course (such as FRE&nbsp;211, 215, 217, 221, 222, 224, 225&nbsp;or&nbsp;ITA 208, 209, 220, 224, 225)&nbsp;before enrolling in a 300-level.&nbsp;Majors who plan to participate in one of the certificate programs, such as African studies, African-American studies, European cultural studies, Latin American studies, or gender and sexuality studies, must also satisfy the prerequisites of that program.</p></div>
  </div>
<div class="field field--name-field-ua-program-of-study field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Program of Study</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>All students are expected to include one advanced language course (FRE 207, 307, 407; ITA 207, 307) in their major subject(s). For majors in French in the classes of 2021 and beyond, the junior seminar (FRE 398), is mandatory. Any two of the following courses can count&nbsp;for course credit for the departmental requirement: FRE 207, 208, 211, 215, 217, 221, 222, 224, 225; ITA 207, 208, 209, 220, 224, 225.</p>

<p>Courses taught in the department place varying emphases on language, literary history and interpretation, aesthetics and literary theory, and cultural and intellectual history. Students are therefore able to pursue courses of study that are consistent with their own interests. To complement this individualized approach to students' plans of study, the department offers four distinct tracks within the major in French and/or Italian:</p>

<p><strong>Track 1<em>. MAJOR IN ONE LANGUAGE, LITERATURE, AND CULTURE</em></strong><br>
Students major in French <em>or</em>&nbsp;Italian. <strong>Eight</strong> upper-division courses are counted toward the major. At least <strong>five</strong> of these must be in the language and subject of the major. Up to <strong>two</strong>&nbsp;of the five&nbsp;departmental courses may be taken at the <strong>200 level</strong> (but FRE 207 and 208, or ITA 207 and 208, cannot both be counted). Up to <strong>three</strong> of the eight may be cognate courses approved by the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) and drawn from other sections of the department or from other humanities and social science subjects.</p>

<p><strong>Track 2<em>.&nbsp;MAJOR IN TWO LANGUAGES, LITERATURES, AND CULTURES</em></strong><br>
Students intending to combine work in French or Italian with another language, civilization and culture&nbsp;normally take a minimum of <strong>eight</strong> upper-division courses: <strong>five</strong> in French or Italian (one of which may be a cognate) and <strong>three</strong> in the other relevant language. Up to <strong>two</strong> of the five departmental courses may be taken at the <strong>200 level</strong> (but FRE 207 and 208, or ITA 207 and 208, cannot both be counted).</p>

<p><strong>Track 3<em>. MAJOR IN FRENCH OR ITALIAN AND ANOTHER FIELD</em></strong><br>
Students intending to combine work in French or Italian and another related field normally take a minimum of <strong>eight</strong> upper-division courses: <strong>five</strong> in the relevant language and literature (one of which may be a cognate) and <strong>three </strong>in the other field. For example, students specializing in French or Italian and History, Politics, or Art and Archaeology, might take appropriate 300-level or higher courses in those departments. Students should consult with their director of undergraduate studies before course enrollment. Up to <strong>two</strong> of the five departmental courses may be taken at the <strong>200 level</strong> (but FRE 207 and 208, or ITA 207 and 208, cannot both be counted).</p>

<p><strong>Track 4<em>. MAJOR IN FRENCH OR ITALIAN AND THE CREATIVE ARTS</em></strong><br>
This track is designed for students who wish to&nbsp;combine work in French or Italian and a creative art, such as theater, music, dance, painting, film, translation and creative writing. Upon approval by the director of undergraduate studies, the student would normally&nbsp;take a minimum of <strong>eight</strong> upper-division courses: <strong>five</strong> in the relevant language and literature and <strong>three</strong> in the field related to the art of interest. Up to <strong>two</strong> of the five departmental courses may be taken at the <strong>200 level</strong> (but FRE 207 and 208, or ITA 207 and 208, cannot both be counted). In some cases, an original work of creation (paintings, prose, or poetry, etc.), or of performance (theater, etc.), may substitute for the senior thesis, but not for one of the two junior papers. In these cases, students will also be required to submit a substantial critical work of <strong>at least 6,000&nbsp;but no more than 10,000 words</strong> (25–35 pages), in which they will position and discuss their creative work in relation to the historical and cultural context of the language in question. The creative portion of the thesis must also have an obvious French, Francophone or Italian cultural component, approved in advance by the student's adviser.</p>

<p><strong>Important Note: Any upper-level course taught in English will require all written work to be completed in French or Italian in order to count toward the major or certificate.</strong></p></div>

<div class="field field--name-field-ua-independent-work field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4><strong>Junior Papers</strong></h4>

<p>Upon entering the department, and in all cases no later than the spring of sophomore year, students should discuss their likely area of interest with the director of undergraduate studies&nbsp;so that students can be paired with the most compatible adviser. The adviser will be assigned at the beginning of junior year. Students should contact their junior adviser and plan regular meetings. In consultation with their adviser, students will also choose the language in which they will draft their paper. It is the responsibility of the student to make and keep these arrangements.</p>

<p>The first junior paper, written in the fall semester, should be about 4,000 words. The second junior paper, written in the spring semester, should be between 5,000 and 8,000 words. Both junior papers may be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the relevant language must be provided. If the paper is written in the relevant language, a three-page summary in English is required.</p>

<p>Students following tracks 2 or 3 may write one junior paper in one of their two majors subjects, and one in the other.</p>

<p>In preparing their papers, students should conform to the principles specified in the University's instructions for writing essays. Formatting should consistently follow either the <em>Modern Language Association Handbook</em> or <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>.</p>

<h4><strong>Senior Thesis</strong></h4>

<p>As the culmination of their independent work, senior students write a thesis on an approved topic. Late in their junior year, students will discuss possible areas of interest with the director of undergraduate studies. Topics chosen in the past have ranged across the field of French, Francophone and Italian studies, from linguistic problems and literary techniques to close textual analysis to thematic and cultural&nbsp;study. Students primarily interested in culture and civilization have written on art, on political and economic issues, on education and on a variety of social questions. For students following tracks 2, 3, and 4, joint supervision may be arranged. The senior thesis is a major commitment of a student's time and energy, and the most important yardstick for choosing a topic is willingness to spend many hours immersed in that particular set of texts or problems.</p>

<p>Majors in French and/or Italian who are also earning certificates should consult with their advisers about selecting a suitable thesis topic. The senior thesis may be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the relevant language must be provided. If the thesis is written in the relevant language, a three-page summary in English is required.</p>

<p>Senior theses should&nbsp;be 15,000–20,000 words in length.</p></div>

<div class="field field--name-field-ua-senior-depart-exam field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Senior Departmental Examination</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The examination, taken in May of senior year, is designed to test aspects of the student's entire program of study in the department. A list of required and recommended readings is provided for each of the languages and literatures taught in the department, and it guides students in preparing for the written examination. The format of the examination is as follows.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Written Component</strong> (three hours) in class, including: (a) A sight translation. This exercise will consist of the translation of a short prose text&nbsp;from French or Italian into English. The resulting translation should reflect the linguistic command and stylistic sophistication expected from a reasonably proficient speaker of French or Italian. For majors following Track 2, and combining French and Italian, the original text will be given in the dominant language. (b) An essay written in the language of specialization. Students will choose one topic out of three culture/literature questions. Topics will be based on the reading lists and course offerings.</li>
	<li><strong>Oral Presentation</strong> (30 minutes). A brief (10–15 minute) oral presentation, in the language of the major (French or Italian), followed by a discussion. The content of the presentation will be determined and prepared by the student in concert with their adviser, and may reflect any aspect of the student's own general intellectual and academic experience in the department. It may therefore stem from the senior thesis, but also largely refer to the overall course of study achieved in the major subject. The examining committee will include at least two permanent faculty of each section.</li>
</ol><p>Note: In order to better prepare for the comprehensive examination, students are strongly encouraged to include either FRE 307 or ITA 307 in their departmental course work.</p></div>

<p>Grades awarded by overseas&nbsp;institutions for courses that are recognized in lieu of Princeton courses are not included in the computation of departmental honors. Juniors who are abroad in the fall semester must take the junior seminar FRE 398 in the fall of their senior year.</p>

<p>Students studying abroad for one or two semesters are not exempted from independent work requirements. The responsibility for consulting with advisers, as well as for meeting all normal deadlines, lies with the student.

<ol><li>A minimum of <strong>four departmental courses</strong> in the relevant language, linguistics, literature or culture, excluding courses that do not have a language prerequisite and any 100-level language course. At least two&nbsp;of these courses must be at the 300 level (or higher).

</ol><p><strong>Please note: Any French or Italian course taught in English will require all written work to be completed in French or Italian in order to count toward the major or certificate.</strong></p>

<ol><li>&nbsp;<strong>Independent Work.</strong> This requirement can be satisfied in one of several ways: (a) through&nbsp;a substantial paper on a topic agreed upon with the student's appointed adviser; (b) through&nbsp;a substantial paper stemming from one of the courses taken to fulfill the certificate requirement (this paper will be in&nbsp;addition to the work required in the course; the subject and scope of this paper will be agreed upon with the student's appointed adviser); or (c) with the agreement of the student's home department, a student may submit a junior independent work (JP)&nbsp;or senior thesis that satisfies the requirements of both the home department and the Department of French and Italian. A JP&nbsp;or senior thesis of this sort should&nbsp;be based in substantial part on&nbsp;language sources, and it should display competence in&nbsp;the language for which the student is requesting certification. Students interested in this option should consult the director of undergraduate studies as early as possible to ensure that the paper or thesis will satisfy the certificate requirements.</li>
</ol><p>Papers of types (a) and (b) are to be approximately 4,000–5,000 words in length. Students are urged to write them in the appropriate language. Alternatively, they may submit the independent work in English together with a 700–1,000-word summary in the language. Students submitting a junior paper or a senior thesis in lieu of independent work [in line with option (c) above] must also submit the summary in the&nbsp;language.</p></div>

                The main objective of this course is to enable you to achieve intermediate communication proficiency in French. All four skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing will be actively practiced in realistic communicative situations, through a variety of activities designed to help you strengthen newly acquired vocabulary and grammatical structures.

                Albert Camus was one of the most acclaimed writers of the 20th century, and one of the most paradoxical. Reading his major narratives, plays, and essays, we will asses how the author found himself often at odds with his own thought and creativity, through his philosophy, politics, or the very act of writing. We will see how Camus, always in between, eternally on the move, can help us face (and revolt against) the nonsense of our world, from pandemics to terrorism, imperialism and totalitarianism, how we can question ourselves and relate to others, while still remembering to seek happiness and beauty.

                What we do or do not eat and where we eat, are questions linked to anthropological and cultural matters. In a socio-political context, food, or the lack thereof, defines a society and its inadequacies. It becomes an agent of power, a metaphor for sex and gender, as well as a means of community. Whether as desire or transgression, whether corporal or spiritual, the representation of food is the depiction of Italian life. This course will examine translated Italian texts, along with visual art and film, in order to explore the function of eating, both as biological necessity as well as metaphor, within Italian society.
