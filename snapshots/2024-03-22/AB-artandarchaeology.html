Students may pursue a major in the History of Art or the Practice of Art; information on the certificate in Archaeology is also included below. Studio art courses are taught by faculty in the Program in Visual Arts; history of art courses also frequently include practical components. Students interested in the practice of art (taught by faculty in the Program in Visual Arts) can pursue a major in the department. Working closely with faculty members in small classes and often dealing directly with original objects and primary sources, students can explore subjects as diverse as Roman or modern city planning, arts of printing and book-making in East Asia or Europe, ancient or medieval archaeology, architectural history, 19th–21st century photography and contemporary arts of Africa, Latin America and the United States.</p>

<p>Students in the Department of Art and Archaeology learn techniques for analyzing and interpreting the visual and material world.&nbsp;They also investigate the factors that influence artistic change (e.g., religious beliefs, economic constraints, patronage demands and technological changes). Like any humanist or social scientist, they must evaluate evidence, form hypotheses, test data and draw conclusions. Successful majors learn to translate their visual perceptions into linguistic expression, develop visual memory and make connections among a wide array of historical evidence. Students must have at least a C- average based on courses and independent work in order to graduate from the department.</p>

<p>Students interested in majoring in the Department of Art and Archaeology must choose one of two tracks, each of which has its own admission prerequisites and curricular requirements.</p></div>
      <div class="field field--name-field-ua-goals field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><ul><li>Students cultivate their abilities to investigate and describe the essential role of art making in a range of histories and cultures. By extension, students develop their abilities to analyze critically and perceptively the products of human civilization and thought.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Students learn techniques by which to analyze visual-material cultures and locate artworks in time and space. They investigate factors that influence the form and direction of artistic practice or change (e.g., economic and social conditions, religious beliefs, patronage demands, technological development).</li>
</ul><ul><li>&nbsp;Students evaluate evidence of various kinds (e.g., material, pictorial, documentary, textual), form hypotheses, test data and draw conclusions. Students engage in experiential learning, and regularly work directly from original sources.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Students learn to effectively translate sensory perceptions into linguistic or material expression, develop visual and/or auditory memory and make connections among a wide array of historical evidence. Practice of Art students additionally develop technical skills in multiple media.</li>
</ul><ul><li>All majors and certificate students reflect thoughtfully and explicitly on method in their respective junior seminars or the Introduction to Archaeology.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Students experience a range of artistic, art historical and archaeological methods and approaches, and have the opportunity to learn from colleagues practicing in diverse sectors of the field. They understand the interdisciplinary methods and commitments of the field, and work directly with primary sources of various kinds (as above, e.g., material culture, photographic or graphic documentation, textual sources).</li>
</ul><p>In support of these goals:</p>

<ul><li>Students have robust access through the department to the activities and communities of the Program in Archaeology and the Lewis Center for the Arts (certificate-granting programs).</li>
</ul><ul><li>Students have robust access through the department to the collections, activities and communities of the Princeton University Art Museum.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Students have robust access through the department to the collections, activities and communities of various units within the department (e.g., Visual Resources, Marquand Library, the Tang Center for East Asian Art, the Index of Medieval Art)&nbsp;and elsewhere on campus (e.g., Firestone Library, Special Collections).</li>

  <h3 class="field__label">Program of Study</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>History of Art Track</h4>

<p>A total of 10 courses in the Department of Art and Archaeology, including ART 400 (Junior Seminar) and an additional two seminars at the 400- or 500-level. Seven of the 10 courses must be taught by Art and Archaeology departmental faculty. Students must take at least one course in each of the following three distribution areas: Group 1 (ancient), Group 2 (medieval/early modern), and Group 3 (19th century to the present).&nbsp; ART 100,&nbsp;ART 400 and ART 401 count as departmentals but not as distribution courses.&nbsp;In choosing courses to satisfy requirements, students are encouraged to explore a range of geographies and a range of media, e.g., architecture, painting, sculpture, photography, works on paper, film.</p>

<h5>Cognates</h5>

<p>No more than two cognate courses taken in other departments (including the Program in Visual Arts) may be counted toward the 10 departmentals. This includes summer courses. Students participating in the Study Abroad Program may be allowed to count more than two courses taken overseas as departmentals. All cognate courses must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies prior to enrollment, based on the submission of a syllabus and course description. Courses cross-listed with the Department of Art and Archaeology automatically count as departmentals, but do not count toward the departmental honors GPA.</p>

<h5>Junior Seminar</h5>

<p>During the fall of junior year, all majors must take the junior seminar (ART 400). The course introduces students to various methods used by art historians and archaeologists, and many assignments relate directly to their junior independent work. Students who are abroad during the fall of junior year can complete the junior seminar during the fall term of their senior year.</p>

<h4>Practice of Art Track</h4>

<p>A total of 10 courses, of which at least six must be from the <a href="http://arts.princeton.edu/academics/visual-arts/" class="ext" data-extlink="" rel="noreferrer" data-once="document-icons">Program in Visual <span class="extlink-nobreak">Arts <svg focusable="false" class="ext" role="img" aria-label="(link is external)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 80 40"><metadata><sfw xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/SaveForWeb/1.0/"><slicesourcebounds y="-8160" x="-8165" width="16389" height="16384" bottomleftorigin="true"></slicesourcebounds><optimizationsettings><targetsettings targetsettingsid="0" fileformat="PNG24Format"><png24format transparency="true" filtered="false" interlaced="false" nomattecolor="false" mattecolor="#FFFFFF"></png24format></targetsettings></optimizationsettings></sfw></metadata><title>(link is external)</title><path d="M48 26c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v26H10V18h26c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2s-0.9-2-2-2H8c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v40c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2h40c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2V28C50 26.9 49.1 26 48 26z"></path><path d="M56 6H44c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2s0.9 2 2 2h7.2L30.6 30.6c-0.8 0.8-0.8 2 0 2.8C31 33.8 31.5 34 32 34s1-0.2 1.4-0.6L54 12.8V20c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2s2-0.9 2-2V8C58 6.9 57.1 6 56 6z"></path></svg></span></a>and&nbsp;four must be from the Department of Art and Archaeology and taught by Art and Archaeology faculty.</p>

<p>The visual arts courses must include: two studio courses in at least two different media; two studio courses at the 300- or 400 level; VIS 392 Issues in Contemporary Art; and VIS 416 Exhibition Issues and Methods or VIS 417 Film Seminar. The Department of Art and Archaeology courses must include one course from Group 1 (ancient) or Group 2 (medieval/early modern) and one course from Group 3 (19th century to the present). The remaining two courses may come from any group. When multiple courses are selected from the same group, breadth in chronological and geographic focus among them is encouraged.</p>

<p>Courses for film students must include: two studio courses at any level in two different media (screenwriting courses are accepted as a different medium from film production courses); two studio courses at the 300- or 400 level; VIS 392; VIS 419 (taken in the spring of junior year). The Department of Art and Archaeology courses must include: one course from Group 1 (ancient) or Group 2 (medieval/early modern); one course from Group 3 (19th century to the present); and two from any group. For two ART courses, film students may substitute film courses cross-listed with ART.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Practice of Art students are strongly encouraged to enroll in ART 400. The course does not carry a Group designation, but counts toward the total of four ART courses for Practice of Art students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Cognates</h5>

<p>Up to two courses in studio art or art history may be taken at other institutions during the summers with prior approval by the director of undergraduate studies (for History of Art courses) or the director of the Program in Visual Arts (for Practice of Art courses). Courses taken as part of the Study Abroad Program may be allowed to count as departmentals with prior approval from the director of undergraduate studies&nbsp;and the director of the Program in Visual Arts.</p>

<h5>Junior Seminar</h5>

<p>During the fall of junior year, all majors must take the junior seminar, VIS 392 Issues in Contemporary Art. Beginning with the Class of 2023, film students will also be required to take VIS 392. VIS 392 coincides with admission to the junior studios and investigates the history, challenges and rewards of studio practice. Through readings, discussions, studio critiques and a culminating exhibition of works in progress, VIS 392 provides the foundation for&nbsp;students' independent creative development, as well as the impetus for beginning to be able to articulate the historical precedents and ambitions of their work.&nbsp;Students are also strongly encouraged to take ART 400, the junior methods seminar in the Department of Art and Archaeology.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>History of Art Track</h4>

<h5>Junior Independent Work</h5>

<p>Junior Independent Work (JIW) begins in the fall, in the context of the junior seminar (ART 400), and continues into the spring with a faculty adviser whom the student selects in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. JIW consists of a research paper of approximately 30–40 pages (7,500–10,000 words) on any topic related to visual and material culture. Assignments in ART 400 help students conceptualize and implement their research agendas.&nbsp;The JIW requirement in History of Art includes two colloquia with the Practice of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.</p>

<h5>Senior Independent Work</h5>

<p>The senior independent work consists of a year-long research project of approximately 60–80 pages (15,000–20,000 words).&nbsp;The student selects a faculty adviser in the spring of their junior year and submits a progress report to the director of undergraduate studies by mid-November of their senior year. For further deadlines see the Undergraduate Handbook; for further details on thesis writing and research, see the Independent Work Guide in the History of Art. The thesis grade is the average of the grades given by the faculty adviser and a second faculty reader. The Senior Independent Work requirement in History of Art includes two colloquia with the Practice of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.</p>

<h4>Practice of Art Track</h4>

<h5>Junior Independent Work</h5>

<p>Junior independent work begins in the fall, in the context of the junior seminar. It continues into the spring in partnership with two faculty advisers, one from VIS and one from ART. Students are provided with studio space and prepare independent work over the course of the year, culminating in an exhibition as part of the Spring Junior Group Thesis Show. Film students work throughout their junior year to create a junior film.</p>

<p>All Practice of Art juniors assemble a writing portfolio consisting of multiple short essays amounting to approximately 10 pages (2,500 words). The essays reflect on the creating process and discuss the relation of the work to the student’s broader studies, especially in art history. The essays should include a bibliography. The grade for independent work is the average of the grade from the VIS and ART advisers.&nbsp;For further description of the portfolios, see the Undergraduate Handbook.</p>

<p>The Junior Independent Work requirement in Practice of Art includes two colloquia with the History of Art cohort, one in the fall and one in the spring.</p>

<h5>Senior Independent Work</h5>

<p>By the end of the second week of the fall term of senior year, students must have three advisers, including one from the Department of Art and Archaeology faculty, who is selected in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. The senior independent work is a major studio project completed by the end of the spring term, done in consultation with the student’s advisers, and a writing portfolio consisting of multiple short essays amounting to approximately 20 pages (5,000 words). The essays reflect on the creating process and discuss the relation of the work to the student's broader studies, especially in art history. The essays should include a bibliography. For further description of the portfolios, see the Undergraduate Handbook. Students are assigned semiprivate studios on the second floor of 185 Nassau. Students present their work in an exhibition at the end of the year at the Lewis Center. An “Advisers' Thesis Critique” is performed by the ART and VIS advisers in the presence of the exhibit. The grade for the senior independent work is the average of the grade given by the ART and VIS advisers during the thesis critique and for the written component.&nbsp;<br>

  <h3 class="field__label">Senior Departmental Examination</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>History of Art Track</h4>

<p>The senior comprehensive departmental examination ("Comps") consists of a one-hour oral examination discussing the senior thesis and also covering material from departmental courses. It is attended by three faculty members,&nbsp;consisting of&nbsp;the adviser of the senior thesis, the&nbsp;second reader, and one additional faculty member. The exam grade is the average of the grades given by the three examiners.</p>

<h4>Practice of Art Track</h4>

<p>The senior departmental examination&nbsp; in the Practice of Arts has two parts. (1) A one-hour critical discussion (the “Crit”) of the senior thesis exhibition in the latter half of the spring term, in the presence of each student's exhibition. The discussion is open to all Program in Visual Arts faculty and Practice of Art/certificate students. All Visual Arts faculty who attend the Crit will grade it, and those grades will be averaged.&nbsp;(2) Practice of Art students participate in the same comprehensive exam ("Comps") as the History of Art students (see above).&nbsp;The VIS primary adviser and the ART adviser&nbsp;will be two of the three faculty present at the comprehensive exam; the three grades will be averaged for the Comps grade.&nbsp;The final grade on the transcript&nbsp;for the departmental examination is the average of the Crit grade and the Comps grade. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Study Abroad</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>Study abroad&nbsp;can be a richly rewarding part of any concentration in the Department of Art and Archaeology. Art history courses taken abroad (normally up to two per term or four for a year in a study abroad program) can be preapproved for departmental credit by the director of undergraduate studies. Students generally study abroad during junior year or the first term of senior year. Junior independent work can be completed under the supervision of a departmental faculty member with prior approval and ongoing contact with the faculty adviser. Senior independent work in the fall of senior year may be done overseas, but the spring term work must be done in residence. Students contemplating study abroad should speak with the director of undergraduate studies as early as possible and meet with a study abroad adviser in the Office of International Programs.</p>

<p>Students interested in archaeology may choose to participate in overseas archaeological excavations undertaken by departmental faculty. For further information, contact the program director.</p>

<p>Nonmajors who would like to receive credit for history of art courses taken during a semester or academic year abroad must apply through the Office of International Programs and receive approval for credit from their study abroad adviser. Credit will not be approved for cognates of Princeton's ART100 course at other institutions (i.e., general survey courses in art history), for majors and nonmajors alike.</p>

<p>If students wish to receive credit for history of art courses taken abroad during the summer, they must receive approval from the Office of International Programs as well as the director of undergraduate studies. This applies to both majors and nonmajors.</p></div>

                Art in late antiquity has often been characterized as an art in decline, but this judgment is relative, relying on standards formulated for art of other periods. Challenging this assumption, we will examine the distinct and powerful transformations within the visual culture of the period between the third and sixth centuries AD. This period witnesses the mutation of the institutions of the Roman Empire into those of the Christian Byzantine Empire. The fundamental change in religious identity that was the basis for this development directly impacted the art from that era that will be the focus of this course.
