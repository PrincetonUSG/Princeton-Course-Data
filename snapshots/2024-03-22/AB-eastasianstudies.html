While the EAS major allows in-depth study and first-hand experience of East Asia, the minor programs in Chinese, Japanese or Korean language encourage students to combine their interests in East Asian languages and civilizations with other majors they pursue at Princeton.</p>

<p>EAS students complete coursework in literature, history, anthropology, media and cultural studies of China, Korea and Japan. They engage in both transnational and local perspectives, and their work spans premodern and contemporary contexts. The Chinese, Japanese and Korean language programs offer instruction from elementary to highly advanced levels. All language classes are taught exclusively by professional instructors and operate entirely in the primary language in terms of reading materials, classroom discussion and assignments. Students also have the opportunity to participate in the Princeton summer language programs Princeton in Beijing (Beijing, China), Princeton in Ishikawa (Kanazawa, Japan) and Princeton in Korea (Seoul, South Korea).&nbsp;</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The Department of East Asian Studies provides students with rigorous training in the study of China, Japan and Korea. The East Asian studies major builds on two pillars: rigorous language training that takes students beyond the third year in Chinese, Japanese or Korean, and diverse content courses that allow students to explore themes from ancient Chinese philosophy to Japanese anime to Korean women’s history. Its interdisciplinary curriculum is designed to provide a balance between broad-based knowledge of the region and deeper expertise in the languages and cultures of one or more of the region’s territories. The goal is for our students to gain proficiency with the challenging linguistic and analytical tools needed to conduct conscientious research, as well as to learn about the critical and theoretical models through which the region’s history and culture are interpreted. The core of this training is developed through guided coursework, of which language classes form a central part, and substantial independent work completed under the close auspices of faculty advisers.</p></div>

      <div class="field__item"><p>Majors are required to achieve proficiency in one East Asian language through the third-year level, and take eight departmental courses. The departmentals must include the junior seminar (EAS 300); at least two of the five transnational courses (HIS/EAS 207, HIS/EAS 208, HUM/EAS/COM 233, HUM/EAS/COM 234, or EAS 229); and at least one course on premodern East Asia. A single course may not be used to satisfy two requirements, with the exception of HIS 207 and HUM 233, either of which may be used to satisfy the requirement of a course on premodern East Asia. A minimum of six of the eight departmentals must be EAS-prefixed courses. The remaining two may be language courses at or above the 300 level (after the three-year proficiency requirement is fulfilled), or any language courses in a second East Asian language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Departmental Course Requirements</h4>

<p>Eight departmental courses fulfilling the following requirements:</p>

<h4><strong>Six EAS-prefix courses, which must include:</strong></h4>

  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>Junior Year</h4>

<p>In the fall term the student participates in the departmental junior seminar (EAS 300) and also writes a junior independent work. In the spring, the student writes a second junior independent work under the supervision of an appropriate faculty member. At the end of junior year, the student begins to draft a proposal for the senior thesis.</p>

<h4>Senior Year</h4>

<p>Each student prepares a senior thesis in consultation with an appropriate member of the faculty. The senior thesis represents the culmination of the undergraduate curriculum. It should be an original contribution to scholarship on East Asia, based at least in part on source materials in the student's language of specialization.</p>

<p>Scholarship aid is available for senior thesis research abroad. Students should review funding opportunities listed in the Student Activities Funding Engine (SAFE), and may also want to consult the websites of the Program in East Asian Studies (EAP) and the Office of the Dean of the College (ODOC) for further information.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Senior Departmental Examination</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>At the end of the spring term, the student appears before a faculty committee for an oral defense of the thesis. The defense will take the form of a conversation between the student and a faculty committee, and it will center on the senior independent work, as well as larger questions in the field of East Asian studies that inform it. Students will be asked to reflect on the process of their research: the original source of interest in their research topic; the process of fleshing out the architecture of their project; and difficulties and creative discoveries of their research and writing. The conversation will begin in the students’ primary research language: Korean, Japanese or Chinese.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Study Abroad</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The Department of East Asian Studies offers varied opportunities for overseas study in East Asia. Major and non-major East Asian language students are encouraged to take advantage of intensive summer or year-long language study and/or internships. The programs hosted by East Asian studies are the intensive summer language programs, Princeton in Beijing (Chinese), Princeton in Ishikawa (Japanese), and Princeton in Korea (Korean). Upon graduation, students will normally be prepared to begin graduate work at a higher level because of such language experience and training. The department also encourages students to participate in extended internships or study programs in East Asia.</p>

<p>Scholarship aid is available to majors and non-majors for both summer language study and senior thesis research abroad. Students should review funding opportunities listed in the Student Activities Funding Engine (SAFE), and may also want to consult the websites of the Program in East Asian Studies (EAP), the Office of International Programs (OIP) and the Office of the Dean of the College (ODOC) for further information.</p></div>

                This course provides an introduction to the Japanese literary tradition, with a focus on narratives of passion and renunciation. Love poems are found among the earliest Japanese writings, but they stand side-by-side with Buddhist-influenced works that stress the suffering inherent in emotional attachment. We will trace this binary of longing and denial through early folksongs, palace gossip, pious sermons, and ghostly pantomimes, against the changing backdrop of Japan's social and intellectual history. No knowledge of Japanese required.

                The seminar will encourage students to think critically about the documentary as artistic medium and as socio-political practice. Some important questions will focus on the form itself: who has produced and watched these films and through what sorts of technologies? What are the codes through which documentaries make sense of their subjects and how do these change? Other questions will have wider scope: how can filmmaking impact politics and culture? How does it deal with the gap between reality and representation? What are the ethical issues of such work? What, if anything, is distinct about the life of documentary films in East Asia?

Topics include: styles of care for the mentally ill, the politics of disability, notions of human life and death, responses to bio-technology, the management of human materials (such as organs), cultural definitions of addiction and "co-dependency," and the ethics of human enhancement.

This course sets out to scrutinize these very real and productive imaginaries. Primary engagements will include official speeches and documents, artistic productions and defector testimonies from North Korea, as well as historical research, policy analysis, journalism, and non-state activities from outside the nation's borders. The task of understanding this most troubled of states will be challenged by visits from journalists, former intelligence or policy consultants, defectors, and religious groups.

                This is a broad historical examination of Korean cinema from both sides of the DMZ.  We start with some rare surviving colonial period films and work our way to the very recent films of the "Korean wave" era.  Our thermatic focus will be post-coloniality, ideological division, war, national reconstruction, democratization, and intensified global capitalism; our critical focus will be on problems of nation, class, and gender.  At the heart of work for the course will be attention to the films themselves, where we will try to account critically for shifts in style and form.

                The seminar explores conversion in media discourses and practices of the Cold War, with a focus on Asia. Conversion is approached as a protean figure spanning religious doctrine, forces of economic mobility, cross-cultural encounters, and states of political subjectivity. Its media forms include portrayals of brainwashing, control of networks and content, and ideas about media's hypnotic power. The seminar inquires into how conversion attained heightened conceptual force during the Cold War and will examine quasi-scientific notions of brainwashing, the proliferation of religious cults, and the hardening of ideological binarism.
