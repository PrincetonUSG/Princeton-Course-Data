We encourage and facilitate interdisciplinary work, and our faculty are active in many other departments and programs on campus, including the Program in Latin American Studies, international and regional studies, Brazil LAB, American studies, global health, media and modernity, the School of Architecture, comparative literature, Renaissance studies, history, art and archaeology, the Art Museum and the Environmental Institute.</p>

<p>Our mission is to help Princeton students&nbsp;flourish as&nbsp;global citizens, ready to face the challenges posed by an increasingly cosmopolitan and multilingual professional world. With this general purpose in mind, we offer a full range of language courses, advanced seminars on literature and culture, translation workshops and the opportunity for independent study. With the support and guidance of our talented faculty, students can study not only the Spanish and Portuguese languages, but also literatures,&nbsp;visual arts,&nbsp;music,&nbsp;urban cultures, as well as the complex political and social histories of the Hispanic and Luso-Afro-Brazilian worlds.</p>

<p>Students become familiar with renowned writers such as Miguel de Cervantes and Jorge Luis Borges; Nobel Prize laureates Gabriela Mistral, José Saramago and Mario Vargas Llosa; influential artists such as the painters Diego Velázquez, Pablo Picasso and Frida Kahlo; the architect Oscar Niemeyer; contemporary musicians Caetano Veloso, Gotan Project and Calle 13; as well as international filmmakers such as Luis Buñuel, Pedro Almodóvar, Kleber Mendonça and Alfonso Cuarón. To experience cultural and linguistic immersion, our students also can study abroad through our popular summer programs in Argentina, Portugal and Spain, or with other approved international programs.</p>

<p>Our&nbsp;majors and certificate recipients are&nbsp;provided&nbsp;with the high linguistic proficiency, cross-cultural literacy and critical and analytical skills that are key for careers in the humanities, law, medicine, government, international relations, international business, education&nbsp;and&nbsp;community-based initiatives&nbsp;today. They also enable students interested in the environment to communicate effectively when doing research or volunteering in Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking regions. Our courses serve as passports for living and working in more than 30 countries, including some of the fastest growing economies in the world.</p>

  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The mission of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese is to provide our majors with a refined knowledge of the literatures, cultures, societies and politics of the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking worlds. To address the range of areas in which this expertise can potentially be deployed, the department offers four different tracks: 1. Spanish Language, Literature and Culture or Portuguese Language, Literature and Culture; 2. POR and SPA Language, Literature and Culture; 3. Interdisciplinary, which combines the target language and culture with another field; and 4. Creative Arts.</p>

<p>In response to the variety of interests and career goals of our students, we have expanded the range of course types and have opened perspectives for independent work. The diversity of the faculty’s approaches, as well as the preeminence of the multidisciplinary perspective represented by cultural studies, allow us to offer courses that include literary, cultural, visual and political analysis, translation theory and practice, studies on diversity and inequality, creative writing, etc. In recent years, our students have successfully defended senior theses of the most diverse nature: e.g., cultural and literary research, journalistic chronicles, ethnography, creative writing.</p>

<p>The academic itinerary of Spanish and Portuguese majors attends the following learning goals:</p>

<ul><li>To acquire a sophisticated knowledge of the contextual and historical specificities of the target culture(s) and their linguistic circulation, as well as to understand their positioning and involvement in global cultural and social networks.</li>
	<li>To master the necessary methodological tools to critically analyze the studied topics. These include but are not limited to literary close reading, film studies&nbsp;and cultural analysis.</li>

  <h3 class="field__label">Prerequisites</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The normal requirement for admission to the department is successful completion of two 200-level courses in Spanish or one 200-level course in Portuguese.</p>

<h4>Declaration of Major</h4>

<p>Before or right after declaring a major in Spanish and/or Portuguese in April of&nbsp;sophomore year, please email the director of undergraduate studies to set up an appointment.</p>

<p>Majors automatically default into the Track 1 subplan. (See track descriptions below.) There will be an opportunity to elect a subplan during the declaration period. However, it can be elected or changed at any time during junior or senior year by contacting the department's undergraduate administrator.</p>

<h4>Early Major</h4>

<p>Qualified students are encouraged to decide on their major as early as possible in their sophomore year. In this way they can benefit from departmental advising on course selection and on the possibility of spending a semester or the whole junior year abroad.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Program of Study</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>All Spanish majors are strongly advised to take one advanced language course (SPA 205, SPA 207, SPA 207S, SPA 208S, SPA 209, or SPA 307), unless the director of undergraduate studies (in consultation with the language directors) determines that the respective student’s language skills do not warrant taking such a course.</p>

<p>All Portuguese majors are required to take at least one 200-level POR course.</p>

<p>All Spanish majors must take one course in pre-1800 literature. University regulations limit to 12 the number of departmental courses allowed to each student in their major. Students cannot earn both a SPO major (in any track) and a SPO certificate (in any language). Students interested in focusing in both Spanish and Portuguese may choose Track 2 for their major.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Departmental Tracks</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>Departmental courses cover a wide array of literary, cultural, social, historical and political topics. Students are therefore able to pursue courses of study that are&nbsp;tailor-made to their own individual interests.&nbsp;The department offers four different tracks for majors.</p>

<p>Please note that an upper division course is any course above Spanish 209 or POR 209.</p>

<h4>Track 1. <em>One Language </em>—<em> Spanish Language, Literature and Culture or Portuguese Language, Literature and Culture Track</em></h4>

<p>Major in one language, literature and culture (Spanish or Portuguese). Requires a minimum of&nbsp;eight upper-division courses in the language of the major.&nbsp;Up to two of those courses may be taken in English, in which case all written work must be completed in the target language.</p>

<h4>Track 2.<strong> </strong><em>Two Languages, Literature and Culture (POR and SPA) Track</em></h4>

<p>Major in two languages, literature and cultures (Spanish and Portuguese; or Spanish/Portuguese and another language). Requires a combination of five upper-division courses in Spanish or Portuguese and three upper-division courses in the second language.&nbsp;One of the five upper-division courses in Spanish or Portuguese may be taken in English, in which case all written work must be completed in the target language.</p>

<h4>Track 3<strong>.&nbsp;</strong><em>Interdisciplinary Track</em></h4>

<p>Major in Spanish or Portuguese with another related field (e.g., urban studies, architecture, global health and health policy, environmental studies, humanistic studies, sociology, European studies, international studies, Latino studies, Latin American studies, comparative literature, history, politics, anthropology). Requires a combination of five upper-division courses in Spanish or Portuguese and three upper-division courses in the secondary field.&nbsp; One of the five upper-division courses in Spanish or Portuguese may be taken in English, in which case all written work must be completed in the target language.</p>

<h4>Track 4.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>Creative Arts Track</em></h4>

<p>Major in Spanish or Portuguese with the creative arts (e.g., creative writing, theater, visual arts, translation). Requires a combination of five upper-division courses in Spanish or Portuguese and three upper-division courses in the creative arts.&nbsp;One of the five upper-division courses in Spanish or Portuguese may be taken in English, in which case all written work must be completed in the target language.</p>

<h5>Track Requirements</h5>

<p>Any track in the major in Spanish and/or Portuguese literature and cultures requires a minimum of eight upper-division courses, at least five of which must be in the language of the major. With the approval of the director of undergraduate studies, up to three courses taken during a semester abroad may count toward the major if the student is pursuing Track 1 or Track 2. Up to two courses taken during a semester abroad may be counted toward the major if the student is pursuing Track 3 or Track 4.</p>

<p>How to Get Started: <em>Language Requirement, Placement Test and Proficiency Evaluations</em></p>

<p>Students who wish to continue a language begun in secondary school must have their proficiency measured either by a College Board score for admission (see Advanced Placement above) or by the <a href="http://spo.princeton.edu/undergraduate/language/placement-test" class="ext" data-extlink="" rel="noreferrer" data-once="document-icons">department's placement <span class="extlink-nobreak">test<svg focusable="false" class="ext" role="img" aria-label="(link is external)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 80 40"><metadata><sfw xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/SaveForWeb/1.0/"><slicesourcebounds y="-8160" x="-8165" width="16389" height="16384" bottomleftorigin="true"></slicesourcebounds><optimizationsettings><targetsettings targetsettingsid="0" fileformat="PNG24Format"><png24format transparency="true" filtered="false" interlaced="false" nomattecolor="false" mattecolor="#FFFFFF"></png24format></targetsettings></optimizationsettings></sfw></metadata><title>(link is external)</title><path d="M48 26c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v26H10V18h26c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2s-0.9-2-2-2H8c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v40c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2h40c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2V28C50 26.9 49.1 26 48 26z"></path><path d="M56 6H44c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2s0.9 2 2 2h7.2L30.6 30.6c-0.8 0.8-0.8 2 0 2.8C31 33.8 31.5 34 32 34s1-0.2 1.4-0.6L54 12.8V20c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2s2-0.9 2-2V8C58 6.9 57.1 6 56 6z"></path></svg></span></a> administered online during the summer before course registration.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Spanish Language Program</h4>

<p>The normal program for beginners seeking a basic mastery of Spanish is the sequence 101, 102, 107, which satisfies the University's language requirement.</p>

<p>Students with a satisfactory score on the department's Spanish language placement test will be placed in either 103 or 105, and will proceed respectively to 107 or 108 to satisfy the University language requirement. They may also be placed directly into 108. Students who have successfully completed 107 may not take 108. Students cannot place into SPA 102 or SPA 107 through the department's placement test.</p>

<p>Course credit in 101-102, 103, 107, or 108 is also available through approved&nbsp;courses&nbsp;outside of Princeton University&nbsp;(see Study Abroad below). Students who take 100-level Spanish courses outside of Princeton University must take the departmental placement test after the completion of their courses to demonstrate that they have reached the necessary proficiency level.</p>

<h4>Portuguese Language Program</h4>

<p>The sequence for beginners seeking a basic mastery of Portuguese is 101, 102, 107, which satisfies the University's language requirement. The sequence for students who have a previous knowledge of a Romance language is 106, 109, which also satisfies the University's language requirement. POR 106 is designed for, but not limited to, students who have already fulfilled the language requirement in Spanish, French or Italian. Students are encouraged to contact an instructor of Portuguese to find out whether they qualify to take 106. POR 199 is an intensive one-semester course and may not be used to fulfill the language requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement is handled on a case-by-case basis. All questions related to 100- and 200-level Portuguese courses can be addressed to the director of the Portuguese Language Program, Nicola Cooney.</p>

<div class="field field--name-field-ua-independent-work field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The program of study in junior and senior years is generally more intensive in its focus, reflecting the requirements of the departmental major the student has chosen. Undergraduates declare their departmental major prior to the start of junior year and complete a program of study that combines a set of courses with junior and senior independent work. Independent work gives students the opportunity to work closely with faculty members on library, laboratory and field-based research, and in sustained writing projects. The independent work requirement, culminating in the senior thesis, is the keystone of the Princeton academic experience. In senior year, students take a departmental examination that is focused on some aspect of their major or on the senior thesis.</p>

<h4>Junior Papers</h4>

<p>Majors are strongly advised to take SPA/POR 330 during the fall of their junior year. This course is designed to introduce students to research methods and to guide them in the production of their first junior paper.</p>

<p>Majors should discuss as soon as possible their area of interest with the director of undergraduate studies in order to find the most appropriate advisers for the junior papers (JPs). By the end of September (first JP), and by mid-February (second JP), all juniors should have contacted their advisers to discuss a plan of work.</p>

<p>The first JP (fall semester) should be about 4,000 words, and the second JP (spring semester) should be between 5,000 and 8,000 words. Both JPs may be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the target language must be provided. Or, the JP can be written in the target language, in which case a summary is not needed. <em>Any extensions beyond the University deadline date need preapproval from both the director of undergraduate studies and the residential college dean.</em> All JPs must include the University's honor pledge.</p>

<p>Majors&nbsp;following two languages are encouraged to write one JP in each of the languages of the majors.</p>

<h4>Senior Thesis</h4>

<p>Majors should select a senior thesis adviser by the end of September at the latest. The senior thesis is normally written in English and should be between 15,000 and 20,000 words. Topics chosen in the past have ranged over the whole field of Spanish and Portuguese studies, from linguistic problems and literary techniques through close textual analysis to thematic and ideological studies. Students primarily interested in culture and civilization have written on art, political and economic issues, education and a variety of social questions. The senior thesis is a major commitment of a student's time and energy, and the most important yardstick for choosing a topic is willingness to spend many hours on a particular set of texts or problems.&nbsp;Please visit the Mudd Library website for inspiration and a listing of previous senior thesis topics over the years.

<h4>Junior Semester / Junior Year Abroad</h4>

<p>Students planning to spend a semester or their whole junior year abroad should seek advice from the director of undergraduate studies and from relevant faculty in choosing a suitable program of study. Further assistance is available from the Office of International Programs. Departmental and University approvals of programs abroad are&nbsp;required.</p>

<p>Grades awarded by overseas institutions for courses that are recognized in lieu of Princeton courses are not included in the consideration of departmental honors.</p>

<p>Students who study abroad are not exempted from independent work requirements. If necessary, the department will decide to find a JP adviser in the location where the student spends the semester or year abroad or will indicate a department adviser who will be in contact with the student throughout the term or year abroad.</p>

<p>Up to three approved courses taken abroad in one semester will normally count for up to three course credits toward the major.

  <h3 class="field__label">Certificate in Language and Culture</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>Admission</h4>

<p>The program is open to all undergraduates in all departments. Ordinarily, students majoring in language and literature departments, including comparative literature, will be eligible for the certificate in language and culture provided that: (a) the linguistic base for the language and culture certificate is different from the linguistic base of the major; and (b) the work required for the language and culture certificate does not duplicate the requirements of the major. Students pursuing area studies certificates may earn the certificate in language and culture provided that: (a) the courses they elect to satisfy the requirements of the area studies program are different from those they elect to satisfy the requirements of the language and culture certificate program (in agreement with the Program in Latin American Studies, one course can be used toward both a certificate in Spanish or Portuguese and a certificate in Latin American Studies; and (b) they submit a piece of independent work in addition to the independent work that satisfies the requirements of the area studies program.</p>

<p>Students wishing to complete a certificate in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Cultures must fill out the <a href="https://spo.princeton.edu/form/certificate-application" class="ext" data-extlink="" rel="noreferrer" data-once="document-icons">Certificate Application <span class="extlink-nobreak">Form<svg focusable="false" class="ext" role="img" aria-label="(link is external)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 80 40"><metadata><sfw xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/SaveForWeb/1.0/"><slicesourcebounds y="-8160" x="-8165" width="16389" height="16384" bottomleftorigin="true"></slicesourcebounds><optimizationsettings><targetsettings targetsettingsid="0" fileformat="PNG24Format"><png24format transparency="true" filtered="false" interlaced="false" nomattecolor="false" mattecolor="#FFFFFF"></png24format></targetsettings></optimizationsettings></sfw></metadata><title>(link is external)</title><path d="M48 26c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v26H10V18h26c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2s-0.9-2-2-2H8c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v40c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2h40c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2V28C50 26.9 49.1 26 48 26z"></path><path d="M56 6H44c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2s0.9 2 2 2h7.2L30.6 30.6c-0.8 0.8-0.8 2 0 2.8C31 33.8 31.5 34 32 34s1-0.2 1.4-0.6L54 12.8V20c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2s2-0.9 2-2V8C58 6.9 57.1 6 56 6z"></path></svg></span></a>. A separate application needs to be completed for each language in which a certificate will be pursued. Please email the undergraduate administrator with general questions, and the director of undergraduate studies regarding preapproval for study abroad courses other than those offered by Princeton.&nbsp;Students may submit applications before their senior year, provided the course requirements have been completed.</p>

<h4>Plan of Study</h4>

<p>The certificate in language and culture is available in Spanish and Portuguese and involves satisfactory completion of the following course requirements:</p>

<h5>Spanish</h5>

<ol><li>Four department-based or cross-listed&nbsp;SPA courses above SPA 209, at least three of which must be 300-level (or higher)&nbsp;in&nbsp;Spanish language, literature&nbsp;or culture. Courses must be taken for a letter grade, not pass/D/fail or audit. **NOTE: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, spring '20 and academic year '20–'21 courses taken PDF will be accepted.** At the discretion of the director of undergraduate studies, students who study abroad during the academic year may count one preapproved course per semester abroad toward the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad course offered through the department would also count. Two preapproved courses in a summer program abroad other than Princeton's can count for one course toward the certificate. In no case, however, can more than two courses taken abroad count toward the certificate. A&nbsp;maximum of one course taught in English may be counted toward&nbsp;the certificate, provided that all written work is submitted in Spanish.</li>
	<li>Independent work. During their senior year, students are required to submit a paper on the topic designated on their application. (See deadline information above.) The paper must be written in Spanish; be at least 6,000 words in length; and be an extension of a paper written for one of the courses taken&nbsp;toward&nbsp;the certificate. Advisers are not assigned.&nbsp;One additional&nbsp;300-level (or higher) SPA&nbsp;course may be substituted for the independent work.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Students interested in earning a certificate in another department's program and in Spanish may earn both certificates provided that: (a) different courses are used to fulfill the requirements for each certificate*; and&nbsp;(b) the student produces two different pieces of independent work. *In agreement with the Program in Latin American Studies, one course can be used toward&nbsp;a certificate in both SPA and PLAS.</li>
</ol><h5>Portuguese</h5>

<ol><li>Three department-based&nbsp;POR courses above the 100 level on the literature and cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world. At least one of these three courses must be at the 200 level. No course taught in English can count toward&nbsp;the certificate. Courses must be taken for a letter grade, no pass/D/fail or audit. **NOTE: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, spring '20 and academic year '20–'21 courses taken PDF will be accepted.** At the discretion of the director of undergraduate studies, students who study abroad during the academic year may count one preapproved course per semester abroad toward&nbsp;the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad course offered through the department would also count, provided that it is taught in Portuguese. Two preapproved courses in a summer program abroad other than Princeton's can count as one course toward&nbsp;the certificate, provided that they are taught in Portuguese.&nbsp;In no case, however, can more than one course taken abroad count toward&nbsp;the certificate.</li>
	<li>Independent work. During their senior year, students are required to submit a paper on the topic designated on their application. (See deadline information above.) The paper must be written in Portuguese; be at least&nbsp;6,000 words in length (title page); and be an extension of a paper written for one of the courses taken&nbsp;toward&nbsp;the certificate. Advisers are not assigned.&nbsp;One additional&nbsp;upper-division POR&nbsp;course (above the 100-level) &nbsp;may be substituted for the independent work.</li>
	<li>Students interested in earning a certificate in&nbsp;another department's program&nbsp;and in&nbsp;Portuguese may earn both certificates provided that: (a) different courses are used to fulfill the requirements for each certificate*; and (b) the student produces two different pieces of independent work. *In agreement with the Program in Latin American Studies, one course can be used toward&nbsp;a certificate in both POR and PLAS.</li>
</ol><p>Students who are pursuing a certificate in Spanish and/or Portuguese must also become familiar with the certificate rules established by the <a href="http://ua.princeton.edu/academic-units/program-language-and-culture" data-once="document-icons">Program in Language and Culture</a>. Upon graduation, students who have met all of the program requirements will have the certificate noted on their record and receive a certificate of proficiency along with their diploma.</p>
