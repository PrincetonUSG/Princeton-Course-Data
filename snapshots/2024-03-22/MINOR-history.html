  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>The history major provides foundational and advanced undergraduate courses on the study of the past. History courses range over the past two thousand years of human experience in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Students can learn about these areas of the globe and periods of the past from a variety of different perspectives including cultural, economic, environmental, ethnic, gender, intellectual, political and social history. Students have the opportunity to pursue independent work in two junior papers and a senior thesis. Within the context of a research seminar in the first semester of their junior year, students learn the basic tools of historical research such as finding a research subject, formulating a historical question and canvasing an archive. In the second semester of their junior year, students pursue a junior paper in consultation with a faculty member and independent of the seminar. In their senior year, students deploy these skills in research and writing a 75-page senior thesis based on original historical research. History majors graduate from Princeton with a sense of the depth and the breadth of the historical study of the human past and with the capacity to express themselves on a range of issues in clear and analytic prose.</p>

      <div class="field__item"><h4>Course Advising</h4>

<p>Before preregistration each term, each history student must consult with one of the department's designated undergraduate advisers.</p>

<h4>Departmental Distribution Requirements</h4>

<p>University regulations stipulate that undergraduates may not take more than 12 departmental courses, plus up to two departmental prerequisites taken during the first or sophomore years. Departmental regulations stipulate that undergraduates must pass at least 10 courses, including HIS 400, in order to receive the A.B. degree. Students who exceed the 31 courses required for graduation will be permitted to take extra departmentals. History courses taken in the first year&nbsp;and sophomore year are numbered among the 10 to 12 required for graduation. Starting with the class of 2023, students must take at least one course in each of the following four thematic areas: Knowledge &amp; Belief (KB), Power &amp; Conflict (PC), Pre-Modern, pre-1700 (PM), Race &amp; Difference (RD).

<h4>Cognates</h4>

<p>The department allows students to take courses in other departments that will add depth and variety to their study of history.&nbsp; When taken during the junior and senior years, up to two (2) such courses may be counted as departmental courses, i.e., cognates, provided they contribute significantly to the student's major and/or independent work, and are substantially historical in their content. Cross-listed courses, such as CLA 217 and NES 201, are not cognates; they are automatically considered departmental courses. The designation of a course as a cognate must be approved by the <a href="https://history.princeton.edu/undergraduate/contacts" class="ext" data-extlink="" rel="noreferrer" data-once="document-icons">director of undergraduate <span class="extlink-nobreak">studies<svg focusable="false" class="ext" role="img" aria-label="(link is external)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 80 40"><metadata><sfw xmlns="http://ns.adobe.com/SaveForWeb/1.0/"><slicesourcebounds y="-8160" x="-8165" width="16389" height="16384" bottomleftorigin="true"></slicesourcebounds><optimizationsettings><targetsettings targetsettingsid="0" fileformat="PNG24Format"><png24format transparency="true" filtered="false" interlaced="false" nomattecolor="false" mattecolor="#FFFFFF"></png24format></targetsettings></optimizationsettings></sfw></metadata><title>(link is external)</title><path d="M48 26c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v26H10V18h26c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2s-0.9-2-2-2H8c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2v40c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2h40c1.1 0 2-0.9 2-2V28C50 26.9 49.1 26 48 26z"></path><path d="M56 6H44c-1.1 0-2 0.9-2 2s0.9 2 2 2h7.2L30.6 30.6c-0.8 0.8-0.8 2 0 2.8C31 33.8 31.5 34 32 34s1-0.2 1.4-0.6L54 12.8V20c0 1.1 0.9 2 2 2s2-0.9 2-2V8C58 6.9 57.1 6 56 6z"></path></svg></span></a>. The designation of a cognate course as a departmental should take place during the enrollment/advising period but no later than the University's "deadline for 'free course' change" (approximately two weeks after the beginning of the semester). Courses cannot be declared cognates retroactively, nor can they be changed later to non-departmentals. Cognate courses do not satisfy distribution requirements; however, they count in the determination of departmental standing and honors.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>Junior Year</h4>

<p>Juniors write two junior papers of roughly 25–30 pages in length, one in each semester.</p>

<p>In the fall term of junior year, students are required to enroll in the HIS 400 Junior Seminars. Work in the junior seminar involves exercises in defining a topic for historical research and in identifying and evaluating a body of historical literature. Each student may expect to gain experience in the use of the library and bibliographical sources, to learn the correct technical form for presenting evidence clearly, and to develop a historical presentation convincingly. Students in HIS 400 will have the opportunity to choose from a number of seminars devoted to historical events or themes of wide importance, such as Irregular Warfare, Space History, Early Native American History, The United States and Latin America, or The Political Uses of American Streets.</p>

<p>In the spring term of junior year, in consultation with their adviser, the student selects a topic and writes a research paper on an independent basis. Written work equivalent to that submitted in the first term is required. The two semesters of junior independent work must be focused in two different geographical fields and in two&nbsp;different time periods. Students should consult their advisers about this requirement.</p>

<h4>Senior Year</h4>

<p>The independent work consists of writing a thesis on an approved subject of the student's choice. The thesis usually relies on research in original source materials, but it may also involve reinterpretation of familiar materials.</p></div>

The themes explored in history courses address questions about the transformation of societies over time and the diversity of human experience, through the study of politics and conflict, religion, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, or the production of knowledge (among many themes). By juxtaposing current-day assumptions and biases against the norms and prejudices from the distant past and other cultures, the study of history provides valuable insights on how we are situated in the present. For students majoring in the natural sciences or engineering, the history minor provides the opportunity to pursue a parallel intellectual journey.

      <div class="field__item"><p>The history minor provides students an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the human past. Through coursework and a research paper, students learn how to pose historical questions, how to build answers by analyzing historical evidence in context, how to evaluate existing interpretations of the past, and how to write persuasively and elegantly. The department’s courses explore a wide variety of regions, themes and periods, and history minors have the flexibility to undertake a broad range of inquiry or to pursue a specific passion in depth. No matter which pathway they choose, though, history minors develop key critical thinking skills. They foster empathy for different perspectives and gain new insight into the diversity of human experience. And they learn to research and debate how and why societies change over time, as well as how prior eras have helped to produce our own. By becoming more informed students of the past, history minors improve their ability to scrutinize the present and to thoughtfully shape the future.</p></div>

                This course will focus on the history of the later Roman Empire, a period which historians often refer to as "Late Antiquity."  We will begin our class in pagan Rome at the start of the third century and end it in Baghdad in the ninth century: in between these two points, the Mediterranean world experienced a series of cultural and political revolutions whose reverberations can still be felt today.  We will witness civil wars, barbarian invasions, the triumph of Christianity over paganism, the fall of the Western Empire, the rise of Islam, the Greco-Arabic translation movement and much more.

                This course introduces students to the multiple and varied experiences of people of Asian heritage in the United States from the 19th century to the present day. It focuses on three major questions: (1) What brought Asians to the United States? (2) How did Asian Americans come to be viewed as a race? (3) How does Asian American experience transform our understanding of U.S. history?  Using newspapers, novels, government reports, and films, this course will cover major topics in Asian American history, including Chinese Exclusion, Japanese internment, transnational adoption, and the model minority stereotype.

                The course focuses on unconventional historical sources and approaches including oral, spatial, computational, and digital history. Conventional written sources typically reflect the biases of a small elite. Oral history can be used to recapture the history of individuals, groups, and phenomena that written sources have erased. Spatial history (through the use of Geographic Information Systems or GIS), digital history, and computational history greatly enrich the study of the past by adding new types of data and by offering platforms to integrate a great variety of sources in new multi-dimensional, multi-media, and interactive formats.

                From colonial settlement to the present, this course weaves a comprehensive history of American cities. Over centuries, cities have symbolized democratic ideals of "melting pots" and innovation, as well as crises of disorder, decline, crime, and poverty. Urban life has concentrated extremes like rich and poor; racial and ethnic divides; philanthropy and greed; skyscrapers and parks; violence and hope; downtown and suburb. The course examines how cities in U.S. history have brokered revolution, transformation and renewal, focusing on class, race, gender, immigration, capitalism, and the built environment.

                For the first seventy-five years of U.S. history, anti-slavery parties were confined to the radical fringe of national politics. Yet just six years after it was founded in 1854, the Republican Party became the only third party organization in U.S. history to capture the Presidency.The triumph of this new, avowedly anti-slavery was unprecedented: "the revolution of 1860," some called it. But who exactly were these Republicans? How did they rise so far, so fast, and against such mighty obstacles? And what sort of world did they want to build? Using both primary and secondary sources, this seminar will explore these and other vital questions.

                Studies of war and society rarely address environmental factors and agency. The relationship between war and environment is often either reduced to a simple environmental determinism or it is depicted as a war against nature and ecosystems, playing down societal dynamics. The seminar explores the different approaches to the war-environment-society nexus and highlights how and why the three spheres should be studied in conjunction. The objective is to assess how and why environmental and societal factors and forces caused and shaped the conflicts and how in turn mass violence shaped societies and how they used and perceived their environments.

                An introduction to the discipline of history aimed at, but not limited to, history majors. Through case studies, students will learn how historians of the last few generations have framed problems, found and interpreted evidence, and built arguments. Participants will both study the major recent movements in the discipline of history and reflect on and improve their own historical techniques. The course will culminate with an examination of history and memory in the early 21st century. Prerequisites: successful completion of the department's junior requirements or comparable work in another department. One three-hour seminar.

                The prison is a growth industry in the U.S.; it is also a central institution in U.S. political and social life, shaping our experience of race, class, gender, sexuality, citizenship, and political possibility. This course explores the history of incarceration over the course of more than two centuries. It tracks the emergence of the penitentiary in the early national period and investigates mass incarceration of the late 20th century. Topics include the relationship between the penitentiary and slavery; the prisoners' rights movement; Japanese internment; immigration detention; and the privatization and globalization of prisons.
