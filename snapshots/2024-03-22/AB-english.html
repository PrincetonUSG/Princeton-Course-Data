The department's ranks include historicists and formalists, theorists and poets, and postcolonialists and feminists; the faculty teach not only poetry, prose and drama, but film, music, art, architecture and technology. The department is united by a passion for works of the imagination and for thinking about what they mean and the difference they make in the world.</p>

<p>The department offers courses that cover more than two millennia of literature and culture, in settings ranging from large lectures to small seminars to one-on-one advising. A typical program of study embraces new and experimental writing, important rediscoveries and the most hallowed texts of the Western literary tradition, the "news that stays news." The department cultivates a common critical vocabulary and joins in debating enduring questions about art, language and society. The junior year begins with a diverse array of junior seminars, which couple the study of a specific subject with methodological training in critical reading and writing. Juniors and seniors pursue independent work on subjects of their choosing in collaboration with the faculty. The department also encourages majors who wish to pursue interdisciplinary work through certificate programs and minors.</p>

<p>English majors graduate as incisive readers, cogent thinkers and persuasive writers. They carry with them a lasting ability to take informed pleasure in all forms of literature, in the process of writing and in the meanings and powers of culture. Graduates go on to become leaders in such fields as education, law, medicine, journalism, business, politics and the creative arts. Simply put, learning to read closely and write fluently — the twin pillars of the discipline — are among the most valuable skills graduates can bring to the world's work.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>Courses in the Department of English enable students to develop crucial transferable skills, including:</p>

<ul><li>Analytical, critical and interpretive skills — students develop these faculties through close attention to the structures of arguments, specific aspects of language and expression, and conceptual synthesis.</li>
	<li>Excellent writing — students develop the ability to communicate in clear, efficient and elegant prose, and to write deliberately with a specific audience in mind.</li>
	<li>The ability to read closely and carefully, to attend to historical, rhetorical and grammatical aspects of English.</li>
	<li>Attention to translation — many students work with texts in other languages, comparing them with their English translations, to comprehend how English relates, stylistically and historically, to materials in other languages.</li>
	<li>Research skills that will enrich and improve these reading and writing skills — for instance, students acquire tools and methods for archival research, to understand the history of books and book production, how to read data and various modes of expression and interpretation, and the histories of aesthetics and literary criticism.</li>
	<li>The ability to understand, engage and assess relevant critical work (secondary sources that comprise the discipline or interdisciplinary fields like American studies, African American studies, Asian American studies, etc.).</li>
	<li>The exercise of these skills with an understanding of historical developments of English-language literatures, demonstrating an ability to situate a text, movement or style in relation to broader aspects of period or genre.</li>
	<li>The exercise of these skills with an understanding of how particular English-language literatures and theories address, and are implicated in, historical operations of power and empire.</li>

	<li>The ability to recognize, use and assess a variety of critical and theoretical perspectives.</li>

<div class="field field--name-field-ua-program-of-study field--type-text-long field--label-above">
  <h3 class="field__label">Program of Study</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>English majors must take a total of 10 courses: the Junior Seminar (ENG 300), one designated course in Literary and Cultural History (LCH), and eight departmental courses. The junior seminar is a topical introduction to research methods in the discipline and prepares students for their independent work. Literary and Cultural History (LCH) courses ask questions about tradition and transmission over longer periods, and provide background for more specialized study.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Distribution Requirements</em></h4>

<p>Departmental distribution requirements ensure breadth in each major's program of study. Everyone must take at least one course in each of the following areas:</p>

<ul><li>Literary and Cultural History (LCH)</li>
	<li>Literature and Culture before 1700 (pre-1700)</li>
	<li>Literature and Culture from 1700–1900 (1700–1900)</li>
	<li>Literature and Culture from 1900–present (post-1900)</li>
	<li>Difference and Diversity (D&amp;D)</li>
	<li>Theory and Criticism (T&amp;C)</li>
</ul><p>Each semester, the department offers a wide variety of courses in each distribution area, and a full list is available on the department website. A&nbsp;single course cannot be used to satisfy two distribution requirements simultaneously. In total: There are six required distributions, plus the junior seminar (ENG 300), plus three additional English courses, for the 10 required courses for the major.</p>

<p>A few rules regarding departmental courses:</p>

<ul><li>Majors may not take English courses on a pass/D/fail (P/D/F) basis. This includes cross-listed courses, even if English is not the home department.</li>
	<li>Students who study abroad may count up to two courses taken abroad as departmental courses. The exception to this is the English department's UCL semester: students may count two classes plus the Princeton seminar.</li>
	<li>Cross-listed courses do not count against the Rule of 12 as long as the home department is not English.</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>The Rule of 12</em>. A student in the A.B. program is limited to 12 one-term courses (plus independent work) in a given department, plus up to two departmental prerequisites taken during the first year&nbsp;or sophomore year. Students who exceed the 31-course requirement for graduation may exceed the Rule of 12 by as many courses (e.g., if you take 32 courses total, you can exceed the rule of 12 by one course). For most English majors, this means only 12 courses primarily designated as English courses (ENG courses or cross-listed courses where ENG comes first—e.g., ENG 327/GSS 332). Departmental cognates do not count against the Rule of 12.</p>

  <h3 class="field__label">Departmental Tracks</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>Tracks and Certificate Programs</h4>

<p><em>Tracks in Creative Writing and Theater.</em> The English department has many majors with a strong interest in creative writing and theater, and offers special programs for students pursuing certificates in those closely related subjects.</p>

<ul><li>Creative Writing: Students accepted to the certificate program in creative writing may cognate two CWR courses as departmental courses in English and may substitute a thesis in CWR for the thesis in English.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Theater: Students accepted to the certificate program in theater may cognate two THR courses as departmental courses in English.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p><em>Certificate Programs.</em> English encourages students with interdisciplinary interests to bring them to the department, and to pursue connections with literary and cultural studies. Students who will receive a certificate in another discipline, and who can show (in their coursework or independent work) vital connections with their studies in English, may count one course in that discipline toward their studies in English, by permission of the director of undergraduate studies.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Independent Work</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><h4>The Junior Seminar (ENG 300)</h4>

<p>The JRS is a required introduction to the methods of research and the arts of criticism that must be taken in the fall of junior year. During the sophomore sign-ins, students are placed into one of four seminars at Princeton. The junior seminar instructor advises each member of the seminar on class selection for the spring.</p>

<p>The completed junior paper takes the form of one 20–30-page JP, which is begun in conjunction with the junior seminar and which students complete in the spring semester, continuing the advising established during the junior seminar for the student's independent work.</p>

<h4>The Senior Thesis</h4>

<p>Theses are 60–75 pages in length, on a topic chosen in collaboration with the thesis adviser. One chapter or 20 pages of the thesis is due in December.</p></div>

<h4><em>Honors </em></h4>

<p>Honors are decided by each cohort and not a set number. Honors in English are computed at graduation according to the following percentages:</p>

<ul><li>Departmental courses (excluding the junior seminar): 50%</li>
	<li>Thesis: 25%</li>
	<li>Junior Independent Work: 7.5% junior paper; 7.5% junior seminar</li>
	<li>Senior Oral&nbsp;Exam and Reflection Paper: 10% (7.5% for the exam, 2.5% for the reflection paper)</li>
</ul><p>Note that in English, it is not permissible to drop the lowest-graded departmental course from your average; all departmental courses are counted.</p></div>

There, students attend a special LCH seminar with a Princeton English professor and receive support for independent work, while also attending courses taught through the University of London.</p>

<p>Courses taken abroad may, with approval, receive both departmental and distribution credit (in general, the department can accept two courses for study abroad). Students considering study abroad should consult the director of undergraduate studies&nbsp;at an early stage.</p></div>

Students read widely across genres and periods of British, American and Anglophone literature as well as across a variety of critical and theoretical approaches. In addition to lectures and seminars devoted to poetry, prose and drama, English offers courses on cinema, photography, architecture, the public essay, and data and culture, among other media and topics. We encourage students to think across disciplines and languages, and we offer vital skills and resources that support independent research.</p>

<p>An English minor serves Princeton undergraduates from all majors, sharpening thinking and writing in ways that support work in their respective concentrations. English courses foreground language, style and rhetoric; they train students’ attention to effective writing as well as to a variety of analytical, critical and interpretive modes. In English courses, students pay close attention to the structures of arguments, to specific aspects of language and expression, to the history of literature in English, and to the cultural and grammatical aspects of the language. English courses also foreground the historical operations of language and power, affording students invaluable resources not only for addressing the inequities and disparities that shape our world but also for imagining the futures that can reinvent that world.</p></div>

  <h3 class="field__label">Goals for Student Learning</h3>
      <div class="field__item"><p>Courses in the Department of English enable students to develop crucial transferable skills, including:</p>

<ul><li>Analytical, critical and interpretive skills — students develop these faculties through close attention to the structures of arguments, specific aspects of language and expression, and conceptual synthesis.</li>
	<li>Excellent writing — students develop the ability to communicate in clear, efficient and elegant prose, and to write deliberately with a specific audience in mind.</li>
	<li>The ability to read closely and carefully, to attend to historical, rhetorical and grammatical aspects of English.</li>
	<li>Attention to translation — many students work with texts in other languages, comparing them with their English translations, to comprehend how English relates, stylistically and historically, to materials in other languages.</li>
	<li>Research skills that will enrich and improve these reading and writing skills — for instance, students acquire tools and methods for archival research, to understand the history of books and book production, how to read data and various modes of expression and interpretation, and the histories of aesthetics and literary criticism.</li>
	<li>The ability to understand, engage and assess relevant critical work (secondary sources that comprise the discipline or interdisciplinary fields like American studies, African American studies, Asian American studies, etc.).</li>
	<li>The exercise of these skills with an understanding of historical developments of English-language literatures, demonstrating an ability to situate a text, movement or style in relation to broader aspects of period or genre.</li>
	<li>The exercise of these skills with an understanding of how particular English-language literatures and theories address, and are implicated in, historical operations of power and empire.</li>
	<li>The ability to propose a subject for sustained research, analysis or critical interpretation, and to see the project to effective completion.</li>
	<li>The ability to recognize, use and assess a variety of critical and theoretical perspectives.</li>

A student might join the minor after that, but only with the support of the DUS and their residential college dean, and after having a detailed conversation about advising and guidelines.</p>

<p>English courses taken prior to the formal declaration of the minor may be counted retroactively.</p></div>

As detailed above, the department will offer suggestions as to possible clusters, but we will also invite students to chart their own paths and propose a new cluster.</p>

<p>Minors are required to complete a reflection paper after completing the requirements for the minor. For this reflection paper, students are tasked with describing their paths through the minor and outlining the knowledge and skills they’ve acquired across their English courses.</p>

<p>Students may submit their reflection papers at any time after they’ve completed the course requirements for the minor, but no later than March of their senior spring. The reflection paper, submitted to the director of the English Minor and read by members of our Committee on Departmental Studies, is the equivalent, for minors, of the Senior Departmental Exam our graduating majors must take, which also includes (as one component) a reflection paper.</p></div>

                This course offers a survey of the varieties of animation across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as well as their critical reception.  Animation is a ubiquitous form, present across media and in advertising. Many viewers take its components and effects for granted. But the archive of animation fundamentally complicates any easy assumptions about "realism" in the twentieth century; animation, moreover, challenges assumptions about bodies and their functions, exaggerating their features and functions, promoting alternatives to more mundane notions of life and liveliness, and relatedly, to ideas of time, contingency, and experience.

It will consider how the afterlife of 19th-century poetry haunts our interpretation of early 20th-century poetry, and re-historicize Victorian poetics amid the vibrant and complicated tapestry of the 19th century.

                The Caribbean is an archipelago made up of islands that both link and separate the Americas - islands that have weathered various waves of colonization, migration, and revolution. How do narratives of the Caribbean represent the collision of political forces and natural environments? Looking to the many abyssal histories of the Caribbean, we will explore questions of indigeneity, colonial contact, iterations of enslavement, and the plantation matrix in literary texts. How do island-writers evoke gender and a poetics of relation that exceeds tourist desire and forceful extraction?

We will look carefully at poetry, plays, utopian fiction, and natural philosophy from early modern England, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and the wider Atlantic world. Orienting our reading around the intersecting paradigms of faith, labor, and utopia, this course will offer us the chance to explore historical theories of gender, sex, and desire as well as consent, race, and property. We will also consider how early modern problems and assumptions inform more recent debates concerning gender and sexuality.

                This course will explore the works of contemporary authors of the African and Caribbean diaspora in Europe and North America in relation to the changing historical and cultural context of migration and globalization. The course will consider how these writers have represented the process of relocation, acculturation, and the transnational moment. What is the role of the imagination in the rethinking of identities lived across boundaries? Why and how do these authors use the term diaspora to describe their experiences? How do the works of a new generation of writers from Africa and the Caribbean transform theories of globalization?

                Courses offered under this rubric will investigate ethical questions in literature. Topics will range from a critical study of the textual forms these questions take to a historical study of an issue traditionally debated by both literature and ethics (responsibility, rhetoric, justice, violence, oppression). Two lectures, one preceptorial.

                In conjunction with University College London, this topic course addresses a range of topics, including the role of class, gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality in the social dynamics of London life. Students will be considering works that represent the city in terms of the longing for kinds of relation that the city promises but may withhold. We will consider London as a city of neighborhoods, a national and imperial metropolis, a postcolonial and global city. By attending to our texts in their historical contexts and in relation to one another, we will be exploring writing about London that is as restless as the city itself.
