  The main learning goal of the Korean language minor is to acquire a solid grasp of the language. There are three components of this overall goal. First, the student will take six language courses, two or more of which must be beyond the second-year level. After taking these courses, students will have the ability to read, write, listen and speak in Korean. The student is also required to take one or more EAS-prefix course or cognate course related to East Asia, giving a foundation in some aspects of East Asian culture. Finally, the student is required to complete a substantial piece of research (20-25 pages) based at least in part on primary sources in the Korean language. These components ensure that the student not only acquires a high level of language competency but also can apply this competency in original research that is well-informed by an understanding of East Asian culture and history.
