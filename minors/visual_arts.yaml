  The Program in Visual Arts, part of the Lewis Center for the Arts, 
  encourages undergraduates to explore visual art and media while 
  developing their creative skills under the aegis of a liberal arts 
  education. Courses are offered in drawing, filmmaking, graphic design, 
  media, painting, photography and sculpture. Studio courses emphasize 
  direct, hands-on art making under the guidance of practicing 
  contemporary artists.
