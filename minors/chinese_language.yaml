description: |-
  The Department of East Asian Studies offers a wide range of undergraduate 
  classes at the highest standards of academic, linguistic and cultural 
  competence focused on China, Japan and Korea. It provides an opportunity 
  for students who plan to major in other disciplines to simultaneously 
  pursue a high level of proficiency in one or more East Asian language 
  (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) and acquire the basic knowledge about the 
  literature, history and culture of East Asia. The student's work is 
  supervised by the faculty members of the department, whose work covers 
  East Asian literature, history, film and media, and anthropology. 
  Students are also encouraged to work with other faculty members conducting 
  research in and teaching on East Asia.
