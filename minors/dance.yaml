  The Program in Dance, part of the Lewis Center for the Arts, 
  welcomes all students to engage and experiment with dance. At the 
  core of the program is the belief that dance fosters an integration 
  of mind and body that allows for a greater connection to ourselves 
  and our communities. To that end, the dance minor offers students deep 
  exposure to and appreciation of dance through practice, performance and 
  critical conversation.
