  Philosophy is of substantial relevance to work in a great variety of 
  other academic subjects, many of which historically emerged 
  originally as branches of philosophy before achieving the status of 
  separate disciplines. The qualities of mind which the study of 
  philosophy aims to cultivate, and which are most often cited by our 
  alumni as their greatest benefit from majoring in the subject, 
  including especially the ability to think and write in a clear and 
  concise, organized and informed and disciplined way about contentious 
  and often confusing issues, are likely to be of value in some way for 
  virtually all students. The option of minoring in philosophy is 
  intended to offer an opportunity to learn such lessons in a structured 
  way, while leaving the student free to pursue virtually any major 
  academic interest.
