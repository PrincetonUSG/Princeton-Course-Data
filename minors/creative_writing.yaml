  The Program in Creative Writing, part of the Lewis Center for the Arts, 
  with a minor in creative writing, like our present certificate students, 
  will encounter a rigorous framework of courses. These courses are designed, 
  first and foremost, to teach the students how to read like a writer, 
  thoughtfully, artistically, curiously, with an open mind attuned to the 
  nuances of any human situation. This skill is not only for students who 
  plan to be professional writers, but most important, this is a skill we 
  believe to be crucial for all students. The many courses offered by the
  creative writing department teach students how to structure a narrative
  and write it well; how to use lived experience in the compressed linguistic 
  construct of a poem so that it provides a meaningful experience for a reader; 
  how to think about, and undertake, the translation of a literary work into 
  another literary work in another language; how to write and adapt literary 
  narratives for a variety of screen media.
