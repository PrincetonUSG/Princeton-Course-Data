  The Program in Humanistic Studies is a minor about major questions: 
  What is it to be human? What do we do with our humanity? How do we 
  experience difference and what role does it play in the good life? 
  How do tradition and transformation make our lives deeper and more 
  dynamic? We address these questions by inviting students to reflect 
  explicitly on the theory and practice of disciplines and to build 
  bridges among them.
