  The Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary 
  forum for the study of gender and sexuality, as well as their 
  intersections with race, class, ethnicity and physical ability 
  across cultures and global geographies both past and present. 
  The program's courses, which are open to all students, examine gender 
  and sexuality from a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary 
  perspectives. The program offers core courses, seminars and 
  cross-listed courses. A current list of course offerings is available 
  on the program website. The program also encourages summer internships 
  in relevant community-based programs, nonprofits and nongovernmental 
  organizations with which the program's theoretical and historical 
  inquiries can be applied in a practical setting.
