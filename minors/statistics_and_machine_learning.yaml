  The Undergraduate Minor Program in Statistics and Machine Learning is designed
  for students, majoring in any department, who have a strong interest in data
  analysis and its application across disciplines. Statistics and machine
  learning, the academic disciplines centered around developing and
  understanding data analysis tools, play an essential role in various
  scientific fields including biology, engineering and the social sciences. This
  new field of “data science” is interdisciplinary, merging contributions from a
  variety of disciplines to address numerous applied problems. Examples of data
  analysis problems include analyzing massive quantities of text and images,
  modeling cellular-biological processes, pricing financial assets, evaluating
  the efficacy of public policy programs and forecasting election outcomes. In
  addition to its importance in scientific research and policymaking, the study
  of data analysis comes with its own theoretical challenges, such as the
  development of methods and algorithms for making reliable inferences from
  high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. The program provides students with a
  set of tools required for addressing these emerging challenges. Through the
  program, students will learn basic theoretical frameworks and also leave them
  equipped to apply statistics and machine learning methods to many problems of
  interest.

          Taking one of the approved core statistics courses provides a basic
          understanding of probability. An additional course from ORF 309/SML
          305 is strongly recommended for students interested in advanced
          machine learning courses.

          Students who take both SML 301 and SML 310/312 will only receive
          credit for one course. SML 310 and SML 312 are project based courses,
          while SML 301 is a lecture based course. However, there is
          considerable overlap in course content. Hence a student can take at
          most one of these courses.

      Students are required to complete at least one semester of independent
      work in their junior or senior year on a topic that applies SML methods or
      investigates these methods. This work may be used to satisfy the IW
      requirement of the SML minor and the student's major. All work will be
      reviewed by the Statistics and Machine Learning Minor committee. In May,
      there will be an (online) poster session in which students must present
      their independent work to other students, researchers and the faculty.
      Students must adhere to submission due dates for independent work papers
      and poster requirements.
