  The Undergraduate Minor Program in Statistics and Machine Learning is 
  designed for students, majoring in any department, who have a strong 
  interest in data analysis and its application across disciplines. 
  Statistics and machine learning, the academic disciplines centered 
  around developing and understanding data analysis tools, play an 
  essential role in various scientific fields including biology, 
  engineering and the social sciences. This new field of “data science” 
  is interdisciplinary, merging contributions from a variety of 
  disciplines to address numerous applied problems. Examples of data 
  analysis problems include analyzing massive quantities of text and 
  images, modeling cellular-biological processes, pricing financial 
  assets, evaluating the efficacy of public policy programs and 
  forecasting election outcomes. In addition to its importance in 
  scientific research and policymaking, the study of data analysis 
  comes with its own theoretical challenges, such as the development 
  of methods and algorithms for making reliable inferences from 
  high-dimensional and heterogeneous data. The program provides students 
  with a set of tools required for addressing these emerging challenges. 
  Through the program, students will learn basic theoretical frameworks 
  and also leave them equipped to apply statistics and machine learning 
  methods to many problems of interest.
