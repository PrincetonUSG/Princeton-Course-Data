  Under the auspices of the Bendheim Center for Finance, Princeton 
  undergraduates majoring in any department may earn a minor that 
  attests to their proficiency in the discipline of finance. 
  The rapidly developing field of finance focuses on the pricing of 
  financial assets, including equities, bonds, currencies and derivative 
  securities; portfolio management and the evaluation of financial risks; 
  banking and financial intermediation; the financing of corporations; 
  corporate governance; financial market and banking regulation; and 
  many other topics. In addition to the obvious practical relevance of 
  finance, the field contains both challenging intellectual problems 
  and a distinctive formal framework within which those problems can 
  be addressed. Knowledge of modern finance is also essential to the 
  proper understanding of many other topics in economics and public 
  policy, including the determination of exchange rates and 
  international capital flows, the making of monetary and fiscal 
  policy, the role of financial reform in developing and transition 
  economies, the regulation and taxation of financial markets and 
  financial instruments, and antitrust policy. Finally, modern finance 
  is remarkably eclectic, drawing from many disciplines besides economics, 
  including mathematics, operations research, engineering, computer science, 
  psychology, politics and history.
