  Princeton students are part of a new global health generation â€” a 
  generation that witnesses first-hand the pressing health challenges 
  in the world and wants to do something about them. The minor in Global 
  Health and Health Policy (GHP) equips students with the cutting-edge 
  tools, real-life experiences and critical perspectives to make 
  meaningful change in the health sphere.

  The minor in Global Health and Health Policy provides students a 
  foundational grounding in the core interdisciplinary issues of 
  global health. These include the biological, social and environmental 
  determinants of health; public health policy and politics; 
  epidemiology; comparative approaches to health-care provision; 
  medical anthropology; health ethics; and social justice. 
  Participating students learn about and collaborate with diverse 
  communities around the world and in the United States.
