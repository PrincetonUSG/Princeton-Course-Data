  The Program in Latino Studies, administered by the Effron Center 
  for the Study of America, offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that 
  traverses the arts, humanities and social sciences. The program is 
  designed to provide students with a broad understanding of the 
  emergence, transformation and consolidation of Latino/a/x as a 
  pan-ethnic group central to the development of the United States as 
  a nation. The course of study also highlights the transnational 
  connections and contexts of Latino/a/x peoples across the Americas, 
  including dynamics of globalization, migration, colonialism, 
  imperialism, citizenship and diaspora.
