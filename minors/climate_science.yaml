description: >-
  Climate science is math, physics, chemistry, biology and computer sciences,
  applied together to understand how Earth's climate works, how it has changed
  in the past and how it will change in the future. Whether students are
  interested in policymaking, sustainability, natural hazards, city planning,
  pollution, geoengineering, natural resources, energy or conservation, a broad
  and accurate understanding of climate science is required.  The minor in
  climate science is offered by the Department of Geosciences.

    explanation: >-
      Students start with 3-4 core classes. These core courses are taught every
      year and represent a comprehensive climate science curriculum designed to
      be accessible to non-STEM majors.

      After finishing 3-4 courses in the core curriculum, students choose 1-2
      capstone electives. These capstone electives are designed to build on
      knowledge gained from the core courses and focus deeper attention on
      specific aspects of climate science. For students who have completed the
      prerequisites, there also is a collection of climate-related advanced
      electives that they can substitute for core or capstone courses with
      permission of the DoM.
