description: |-
  Climate science is math, physics, chemistry, biology and computer 
  sciences, applied together to understand how Earth's climate works, 
  how it has changed in the past and how it will change in the future. 
  Whether students are interested in policymaking, sustainability, 
  natural hazards, city planning, pollution, geoengineering, natural 
  resources, energy or conservation, a broad and accurate understanding 
  of climate science is required.  The minor in climate science is offered 
  by the Department of Geosciences.
