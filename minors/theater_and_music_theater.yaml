  The Program in Theater and Music Theater welcomes all students 
  interested in exploring theater and music theater, with or without 
  previous experience. We approach theater and music theater from a 
  liberal arts perspectiveâ€” as intensely collaborative art forms, as 
  key components of world cultures and as performance genres that shape 
  and are shaped by history, economics, politics and technology. 
  We research, study and perform theater, from classic plays, operas 
  and musicals to contemporary, experimental and devised plays, 
  performances and musicals. We offer a wide-ranging, innovative and 
  student-initiated season of theatrical explorations, produced in 
  collaboration with professional artists and craftspeople. Our season 
  centers on community-building and the creation of original work, 
  in which all students can participate, We encourage artistic and 
  academic investigations of theater and music theater in conversation 
  with every other area of study.
