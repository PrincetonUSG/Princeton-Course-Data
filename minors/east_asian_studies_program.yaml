description: |-
  The Program in East Asian Studies is an interdepartmental center directed 
  by representatives of the cooperating departments — Anthropology, 
  Art and Archaeology, Comparative Literature, East Asian Studies, 
  Economics, History, Music, Politics, Religion, and Sociology — as 
  well as the School of Public and International Affairs. It is designed 
  to educate internationally minded students with basic competence in 
  East Asia. The program provides an opportunity for students who plan 
  to major in other disciplines to simultaneously pursue the study of 
  East Asian language arts, history and other disciplines. East Asia is 
  defined as those areas where Chinese, Korean, or Japanese is the dominant 
  language, although courses and independent research in Vietnam may also 
  be included as an area of study. The student's work is supervised by the 
  appropriate representative of a cooperating department in consultation 
  with the East Asian Studies program director.
