  The Computer Science Minor is designed for students who want to 
  combine the study of computing and computers with another academic 
  discipline. The program welcomes students not only from areas that 
  traditionally make heavy use of computation (such as engineering, 
  the natural sciences and mathematics) but also from newer and emerging 
  application areas (such as neuroscience, digital humanities, 
  technology policy, music, visual arts, economics, linguistics and 
  philosophy). Many students find this program an effective way to 
  apply computer science to their own specialties, and to understand 
  how computation and technology are transforming our world.
