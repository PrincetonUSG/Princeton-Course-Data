  The minor in neuroscience at Princeton is designed for Princeton 
  University undergraduate students with a strong interest in the brain 
  but whose primary studies are in a different subject area. The 
  certificate in neuroscience has been serving this function since 
  2006, but since neuroscience now has a major, transitioning the 
  certificate to a minor is appropriate. The PNI faculty believe that 
  the current requirements of the NEU certificate are sufficient for a 
  minor and have endorsed changing the name without modifications to 
  the requirements. The requirements for the NEU minor are all related 
  to coursework. There is no independent work requirement for the 
  neuroscience certificate.
