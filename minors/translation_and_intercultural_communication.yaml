  The Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication (PTIC) takes 
  linguistic translation as its base and offers a diverse set of
   undergraduate courses that allow students to develop an understanding 
   of translation from varied perspectives. Most courses are taught by 
   faculty in humanities departments, but we also consider the ways 
   translation functions in the social sciences, the hard sciences, 
   the arts, and engineering. At PTIC, we recognize translation as crucial 
   to the production and circulation of work in all fields, and to our 
   everyday lives as inhabitants of a multilingual and interconnected world. 
   Undergraduates in our program have pursued majors in departments 
   including anthropology, comparative literature, ecology and evolutionary 
   biology, history, Near Eastern studies, operations research and 
   financial engineering, politics, and many more. We encourage students 
   from all departments and disciplines to explore our offerings, 
   regardless of their prior experience with translation.
