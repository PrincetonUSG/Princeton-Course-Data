  The history minor provides students an opportunity to gain a deeper 
  understanding of the human past. Through coursework and a research 
  paper, students learn how to pose historical questions, how to 
  build answers by analyzing historical evidence in context, 
  how to evaluate existing interpretations of the past, and how to 
  write persuasively and elegantly. The department's courses explore 
  a wide variety of regions, themes and periods, and history minors 
  have the flexibility to undertake a broad range of inquiry or to 
  pursue a specific passion in depth. No matter which pathway they 
  choose, though, history minors develop key critical thinking skills. 
  They foster empathy for different perspectives and gain new insight 
  into the diversity of human experience. And they learn to research 
  and debate how and why societies change over time, as well as how 
  prior eras have helped to produce our own. By becoming more informed 
  students of the past, history minors improve their ability to 
  scrutinize the present and to thoughtfully shape the future.
