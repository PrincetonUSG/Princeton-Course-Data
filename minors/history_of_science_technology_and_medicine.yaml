description: |-
  From climate change to pandemics to the transformative effects of 
  information technology, many of the challenges we confront today are 
  inseparable from science, technology and medicine, whether as cause, 
  explanation or remedy. To understand the role of STM in our present 
  predicament and think through how it will shape our future, a 
  historical perspective is vital. In the HSTM minor, students will 
  learn from the array of methodological approaches developed by 
  historians of science, technology and medicine, and track the evolution 
  of modern science from antiquity to the present, in many of the world's 
  cultures. For students majoring in the humanities and social sciences, 
  the HSTM minor enhances their understanding of the content, methodologies 
  and impacts of science, technology and medicine; in a complementary fashion, 
  the HSTM minor provides students majoring in the natural sciences or 
  engineering a richer appreciation of the social and cultural aspects 
  of their fields, as well as the trajectories that brought their subjects 
  to their present state.
