  The Program in Medieval Studies encourages the interdisciplinary study 
  of the Middle Ages: its art, literature (Latin and vernacular), 
  music, religion, science, philosophy, politics, and economic and 
  social structures. Supported by the vast resources for medieval 
  studies at Princeton (including an outstanding medieval manuscript 
  collection and the photographic archive known as the Index of Medieval 
  Art), the program sponsors one course: an introductory seminar, and a 
  (noncredit) thesis writers' colloquium for seniors. Other courses 
  directly relevant to medieval studies are listed under the courses 
  section. The minor's multidisciplinary training in the study of
  history, culture and society fosters students' future work in 
  fields such as media, heritage management, archives and museums, 
  publishing industries, legal studies, public scholarship and 
  academic research.
