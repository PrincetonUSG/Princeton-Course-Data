description: >-
  The Program in Medieval Studies provides a platform for the study of histories
  and cultures from roughly the 3rd to the 16th centuries C.E. The program
  brings together faculty, graduates and undergraduates from various departments
  and units across the humanities and social sciences, as well as computer
  sciences and engineering. We offer a capacious minor degree, in which students
  explore the past through the cutting-edge methods and questions of various
  contemporary disciplines, including archaeology, biology, art history,
  computer science, anthropology, literatures and languages, manuscript studies,
  archival studies, history, religious studies, environmental history, and
  biology and chemistry. Guided by members of our faculty, students develop
  individual approaches and techniques to studying cultures of the past and
  their continued importance today. Courses and independent work prioritize
  students' direct engagement with primary sources, often working out of
  Princeton's extraordinary collections. The program prizes scholarly community:
  undergraduates study in formal collaboration through their senior colloquium
  and enjoy many opportunities to engage with faculty, graduate students and one
  another through regular program activities.

  The minor's multidisciplinary training in the study of history, culture and
  society fosters students' future work in fields such as media, heritage
  management, archives and museums, publishing industries, legal studies, public
  scholarship and academic research.

      200-level Introductory Class. MED/HUM/HIS/HLS 227 (Worlds of the Middle
      Ages), offered in alternate falls, is the designated introductory course
      for the minor. Students may consult the director for comparably broad
      introductory course offerings that may be taken instead (e.g., HUM216-217,
      HIS210, ART228). Students are encouraged to complete their introductory
      class as early as possible in their course of study.

      Students may complete a fifth course at the 400 level (or 500 level with
      the permission of the instructor) in lieu of independent work, but are
      also required to present and discuss these projects in the senior thesis
      colloquium.

          One larger final project on a relevant topic completed in the senior
          year, amounting to the equivalent of one thesis chapter or more.
          Project forms include: a departmental senior thesis, a substantive
          data-based project on primary sources and materials, internships that
          require intensive work with primary sources. Please discuss the range
          of possibilities (and Princeton's own opportunities) with the
          director. In the senior thesis colloquium, taught by the director of
          the program, these projects, activities, experiences and expertise
          will be regularly presented and discussed during senior year.
