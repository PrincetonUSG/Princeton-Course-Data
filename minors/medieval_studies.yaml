description: |-
  The Program in Medieval Studies provides a platform for the study of histories and cultures from roughly the 3rd to the 16th centuries C.E. The program brings together faculty, graduates and undergraduates from various departments and units across the humanities and social sciences, as well as computer sciences and engineering. We offer a capacious minor degree, in which students explore the past through the cutting-edge methods and questions of various contemporary disciplines, including archaeology, biology, art history, computer science, anthropology, literatures and languages, manuscript studies, archival studies, history, religious studies, environmental history, and biology and chemistry. Guided by members of our faculty, students develop individual approaches and techniques to studying cultures of the past and their continued importance today. Courses and independent work prioritize students' direct engagement with primary sources, often working out of Princeton's extraordinary collections. The program prizes scholarly community: undergraduates study in formal collaboration through their senior colloquium and enjoy many opportunities to engage with faculty, graduate students and one another through regular program activities.
  The minor's multidisciplinary training in the study of history, culture and society fosters students' future work in fields such as media, heritage management, archives and museums, publishing industries, legal studies, public scholarship and academic research.
