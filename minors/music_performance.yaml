description: |-
  The minor in Music Performance is a rigorous opportunity for students 
  to study the performance of vocal and instrumental music (both jazz 
  and classical) or conducting in the context of a liberal arts education. 
  It provides extensive opportunities for students to hone their skills 
  through participation in department ensembles, recitals, studio 
  instruction and performance classes, and also requires coursework 
  in the Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making (M&M) 
  distribution areas. The MPP minor provides a solid foundation for 
  students who may wish to pursue professional music training at the 
  graduate level.
