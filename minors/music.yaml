  The minor in the Department of Music invites students to explore a diverse
  range of fields of study, from composition and electronic music, to
  musicology, theory, sound studies, music cognition, jazz studies and more.
  Students pursue work in two loosely defined areas: Culture and Criticism (C&C)
  and Materials and Making (M&M). M&M encompasses topics usually explored in
  hands-on, exploratory ways, such as composition, improvisation, theory,
  analysis and electronic music. The C&C area focuses on the scholarly study of
  music, from historical and formalist analysis to cognitive science and
  ethnography. While independent work is not required, there are options for
  students interested in pursuing private lessons (in composition and electronic
  music), studies in music cognition (through the Music Cognition Lab), research
  projects with faculty, or the Music Mentorship program that pairs music
  undergraduates with graduate students.

      Two (2) additional MUS courses. By petition to the DUS, one of these
      electives can be outside MUS, though must reflect a coherent plan of study
      (for instance, a particular psychology course in support of a plan of
      study focusing on music cognition)
