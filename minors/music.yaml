  The minor in the Department of Music invites students to explore a 
  diverse range of fields of study, from composition and electronic 
  music, to musicology, theory, sound studies, music cognition, 
  jazz studies and more. Students pursue work in two loosely defined 
  areas: Culture and Criticism (C&C) and Materials and Making (M&M). 
  M&M encompasses topics usually explored in hands-on, exploratory 
  ways, such as composition, improvisation, theory, analysis and 
  electronic music. The C&C area focuses on the scholarly study of 
  music, from historical and formalist analysis to cognitive science 
  and ethnography. While independent work is not required, there are 
  options for students interested in pursuing private lessons 
  (in composition and electronic music), studies in music cognition 
  (through the Music Cognition Lab), research projects with faculty, 
  or the Music Mentorship program that pairs music undergraduates with 
  graduate students.
