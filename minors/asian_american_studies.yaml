description: |-
  The Program in Asian American Studies, administered by the Effron Center 
  for the Study of America, provides students with the opportunity to gain 
  an interdisciplinary perspective on the diversity of Asian American and 
  Pacific Islander histories, cultures and contemporary experiences. 
  The course of study focuses on the formative emergence of this pan-ethnic 
  group in the United States. It also highlights Asian America's transnational 
  connections and contexts, including the dynamics of globalization, migration, 
  imperialism and postcoloniality. The structure of the Program in Asian 
  American Studies facilitates productive engagement with the programs 
  housed in the Effron Center and encourages comparative and intersectional 
  work with the Department of African American Studies, Program in Gender 
  and Sexuality Studies and other relevant fields of study that help to 
  contextualize Asian American histories and cultures within the diversity 
  of experiences in the United States.
