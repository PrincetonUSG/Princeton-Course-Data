  The Program in Asian American Studies, administered by the Effron Center for
  the Study of America, provides students with the opportunity to gain an
  interdisciplinary perspective on the diversity of Asian American and Pacific
  Islander histories, cultures and contemporary experiences. The course of study
  focuses on the formative emergence of this pan-ethnic group in the United
  States. It also highlights Asian America's transnational connections and
  contexts, including the dynamics of globalization, migration, imperialism and
  postcoloniality. The structure of the Program in Asian American Studies
  facilitates productive engagement with the programs housed in the Effron
  Center and encourages comparative and intersectional work with the Department
  of African American Studies, Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies and other
  relevant fields of study that help to contextualize Asian American histories
  and cultures within the diversity of experiences in the United States.

      American studies content for one of these courses.
