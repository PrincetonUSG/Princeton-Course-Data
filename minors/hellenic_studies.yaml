  The minor in Hellenic Studies (HLS) aims to provide students with a 
  thorough introduction to the history, literature, and culture of the 
  Greek-speaking Eastern Mediterranean over the past three thousand years. 
  This minor will allow students to engage, from a variety of disciplinary 
  perspectives, with all aspects of Hellenism, its global encounters, 
  and cross-cultural dialogues. At the same time, students in the Hellenic 
  studies minor will acquire a strong grounding in the long history of 
  this important region of the world.
