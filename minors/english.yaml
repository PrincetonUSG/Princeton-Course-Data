description: |-
  An English minor serves Princeton undergraduates from all majors, 
  sharpening thinking and writing in ways that support work in their 
  respective concentrations. English courses foreground language, style 
  and rhetoric; they train students' attention to effective writing as 
  well as to a variety of analytical, critical and interpretive modes. 
  In English courses, students pay close attention to the structures of 
  arguments, to specific aspects of language and expression, to the 
  history of literature in English, and to the cultural and grammatical 
  aspects of the language. English courses also foreground the historical 
  operations of language and power, affording students invaluable resources 
  not only for addressing the inequities and disparities that shape our world 
  but also for imagining the futures that can reinvent that world.
