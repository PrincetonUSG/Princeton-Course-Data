  An English minor serves Princeton undergraduates from all majors, sharpening
  thinking and writing in ways that support work in their respective
  concentrations. English courses foreground language, style and rhetoric; they
  train students' attention to effective writing as well as to a variety of
  analytical, critical and interpretive modes. In English courses, students pay
  close attention to the structures of arguments, to specific aspects of
  language and expression, to the history of literature in English, and to the
  cultural and grammatical aspects of the language. English courses also
  foreground the historical operations of language and power, affording students
  invaluable resources not only for addressing the inequities and disparities
  that shape our world but also for imagining the futures that can reinvent that
  world.

      English minors must take five courses, at least two of which are seminars.
      Just as there are no prerequisites, there are also no required courses for
      the minor. As detailed above, the department will offer suggestions as to
      possible clusters, but we will also invite students to chart their own
      paths and propose a new cluster.

      Minors are required to complete a reflection paper after completing the
      requirements for the minor. For this reflection paper, students are tasked
      with describing their paths through the minor and outlining the knowledge
      and skills they've acquired across their English courses.

      Students may submit their reflection papers at any time after they've
      completed the course requirements for the minor, but no later than March
      of their senior spring. The reflection paper, submitted to the director of
      the English Minor and read by members of our Committee on Departmental
      Studies, is the equivalent, for minors, of the Senior Departmental Exam
      our graduating majors must take, which also includes (as one component) a
      reflection paper.
