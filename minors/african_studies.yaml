description: |-
  Africa is the continent where humanity began and where its future will 
  be determined. Princeton's minor in African Studies provides opportunities 
  to all Princeton students, regardless of major, to learn about the continent. 
  Students will learn a variety of methods, interdisciplinary approaches 
  and perspectives that will enrich them with critical and analytical tools 
  for engaging with Africa. These perspectives will aid them in their studies 
  generally, enhancing skills used across all disciplines. The minor is devoted 
  to the study of the Histories, Cultures, Religions, Literature, Languages, 
  and Arts of Africa. Classes in Africa's politics, economic life, social 
  history and ecology are offered each semester. The minor also offers classes 
  in Africa's vibrant art scenes, past and present, where literature, music and 
  art have come to define a new postcolonial African cosmopolitanism. 
  Opportunities to learn Swahili and Twi are offered in the fall and spring 
  on campus and internationally each summer. The Program in African Studies 
  is uniquely situated to teach students ethical approaches to the study of 
  Africa that will serve them well in all areas of study.

  explanation: |-
    Five courses are required for the minor â€” one core course and four 
    electives. Students are expected to take one course in the humanities, 
    one African language course (Twi, Ge'ez or Swahili) and one course in 
    the social sciences (History, Politics, Sociology or Anthropology).  
    Any courses cross-listed with the Program in African Studies are 
    preapproved to count toward fulfillment of the minor. Courses not 
    cross-listed with African Studies, but devoting significant course 
    time to issues on the continent, may be submitted for review by the 
    program director for credit.
