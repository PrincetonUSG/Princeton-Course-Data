description: >-
  Africa is the continent where humanity began and where its future will be
  determined. Princeton's minor in African Studies provides opportunities to all
  Princeton students, regardless of major, to learn about the continent.
  Students will learn a variety of methods, interdisciplinary approaches and
  perspectives that will enrich them with critical and analytical tools for
  engaging with Africa. These perspectives will aid them in their studies
  generally, enhancing skills used across all disciplines. The minor is devoted
  to the study of the Histories, Cultures, Religions, Literature, Languages, and
  Arts of Africa. Classes in Africa's politics, economic life, social history
  and ecology are offered each semester. The minor also offers classes in
  Africa's vibrant art scenes, past and present, where literature, music and art
  have come to define a new postcolonial African cosmopolitanism. Opportunities
  to learn Swahili and Twi are offered in the fall and spring on campus and
  internationally each summer. The Program in African Studies is uniquely
  situated to teach students ethical approaches to the study of Africa that will
  serve them well in all areas of study.

      Students should have at least one core course completed by the spring of
      their junior year. One 200- or 300-level course administered or
      cross-listed by the Program in African Studies will serve to fulfill this
      requirement.

      Five courses are required for the minor â€” one core course and four
      electives. Students are expected to take one course in the humanities, one
      African language course (Twi, Ge'ez or Swahili) and one course in the
      social sciences (History, Politics, Sociology or Anthropology).  Any
      courses cross-listed with the Program in African Studies are preapproved
      to count toward fulfillment of the minor. Courses not cross-listed with
      African Studies, but devoting significant course time to issues on the
      continent, may be submitted for review by the program director for credit.

          The requirement of African languages can be fulfilled by one semester
          of an African language on campus or intense study with a summer
          program (SWA 103K or TWI 103G). Two courses counting toward the
          student's major field of concentration may also be counted (or double
          counted) toward fulfilling the minor in African Studies. All courses
          for the PAS minor must be taken for a grade, not pass/D/fail.

      In addition to the coursework, the student will submit a paper dealing
      with Africa. The student may submit the senior thesis or junior paper or
      another substantial piece of original research that meets the same
      standards of relevance to Africa.
