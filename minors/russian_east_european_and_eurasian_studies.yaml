description: |-
  The program's purpose is to provide undergraduates with expertise in a 
  core language of Eurasia and a scholarly grounding in the study of the 
  region. Languages applicable toward the certificate include 
  Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian and 
  Turkish, the last being related to most Central Asian languages 
  as well as some in the Caucasus and in Russia. Russian, East European, 
  and Eurasian Studies offers preparation for government service, 
  international business and finance, law, media, science, teaching, 
  nongovernmental organizations and other aspects of global affairs. 
  As such, courses from many departments count toward the minor. 
  The program is compatible with all majors.
