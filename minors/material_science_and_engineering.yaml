  The minor in Materials Science and Engineering is offered by the Princeton Materials Institute. The program emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of the study of materials and the engineering application of their properties. The program is designed primarily for students in science and engineering departments who are considering careers in materials, or have general interest in materials science and engineering, although students from other disciplines, with appropriate background, may join. Participants in the program will take courses in their own department together with a group of materials courses chosen from a selected list offered by the participating departments and/or the Princeton Materials Institute. Satisfactory completion of the program is recognized by the award of a minor in materials science and engineering upon graduation.
