description: |-
  The minor in Materials Science and Engineering is offered by the 
  Princeton Materials Institute. The program emphasizes the 
  multidisciplinary nature of the study of materials and the 
  engineering application of their properties. The program is 
  designed primarily for students in science and engineering departments 
  who are considering careers in materials, or have general interest 
  in materials science and engineering, although students from other 
  disciplines, with appropriate background, may join. Participants in 
  the program will take courses in their own department together with a 
  group of materials courses chosen from a selected list offered by the 
  participating departments and/or the Princeton Materials Institute. 
  Satisfactory completion of the program is recognized by the award of 
  a minor in materials science and engineering upon graduation.
