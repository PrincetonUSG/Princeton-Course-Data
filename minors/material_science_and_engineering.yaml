  The minor in Materials Science and Engineering is offered by the Princeton
  Materials Institute. The program emphasizes the multidisciplinary nature of
  the study of materials and the engineering application of their properties.
  The program is designed primarily for students in science and engineering
  departments who are considering careers in materials, or have general interest
  in materials science and engineering, although students from other
  disciplines, with appropriate background, may join. Participants in the
  program will take courses in their own department together with a group of
  materials courses chosen from a selected list offered by the participating
  departments and/or the Princeton Materials Institute. Satisfactory completion
  of the program is recognized by the award of a minor in materials science and
  engineering upon graduation.

      Take one year of general physics (PHY 103, 104, or 105, 106, or apply AP
      credit), one term of general chemistry with a materials focus and a
      laboratory (CHM 207, 215, or apply AP credit; CHM 201/202 sequence also
      accepted) and one year of mathematics (any two courses out of MAT 103,
      104, 201, 202, 203 and 204). In addition, a course in quantum mechanics is
      recommended.
